<H1>Tracking Concept Status</H1>

The concept_status table maintains the status of all the concepts
in the MID.  A status of R means the concept has been
reviewed, N means the concept needs review by an editor,
a U indicates the concept is unreviewed and will not
be edited (e.g., MeSH supplementary chemicals), and an E stands
for embryo concepts that have not yet had all their attributes
and/or class memberships assigned.

<P>

Submitting the following form will show a frequency plot of these
values over time. The plot shows R concepts in red, N in blue,
U in green, and E in cyan.

<P>

As new sources are inserted and new concepts
merged with existing ones, the status of the latter will change from R to N.
As concepts pass through the editorial process, their status changes
from N to R.  E concepts should only be present around an insertion.

<P>

Data has been collected daily using the following SQL and is available
in the table: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/table-help.pl?table=ems_concept_status_count">ems_concept_status_count</A></EM>.
