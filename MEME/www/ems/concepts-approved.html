<H1>Tracking Concepts Approved</H1>

This plot shows the number of concepts approved daily over the
past 'n' months.  Concepts are approved by editors either
manually using the interface
or by a batch process known as "stamping" run on behalf of the
editor who had responsibility for that worklist.

<P>

The data is collected daily in the table:
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/table-help.pl?table=ems_edit_count">ems_edit_count</A></EM>.
