<H1>Worklist Management System (WMS)</H1>

The WMS is a Web-based system to track and manage the editing process for the UMLS
Metathesaurus.  The editors (or their managers) and NLM personnel have different levels
of access in the system.  The unit of tracking in the WMS is a <EM>worklist</EM> - a set
of concepts (usually between 200 and 300) that share a editing characteristic such as,
for example, missing semantic types.  Concepts are ordered within a worklist by some criteria,
typically by source hierarchy.

<H1><A NAME="actions">WMS Actions</A></H1>

The WMS implements several "actions" which have the effect of accessing or modifying the
data in the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table in known, predictable ways.
The following actions are currently implemented:

<P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1>

<TR>
  <TH>Action</TH>
  <TH>Description</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>query</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-query">This</A> is the query interface to the WMS.
	  It presents a form that contains criteria for
	  each <A HREF="#worklist_info">table attribute</A> for restricting the set of matching
	  worklists.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>select</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-select">This</A> action is called by the
	  <A HREF="#action-query">query</A> action subsequent to the
	  specification of the selection
	  criteria.  It results in a form containing a table with the matching records from
	  the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table.
	  Based on the <A HREF="#authentication">authenticated</A> user,
	  the form may have different editable fields.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>update</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-update">This</A> is called after the
	  <A HREF="#action-select">select</A> action to update the table
	  with the changes requested.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>view</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-view">This</A> action is a read only view of a
	  worklist in all its glory.  The resulting HTML table
	  has as many rows as there are concepts and has columns for the concept identifier, the
	  term identifier for the constituent terms and the different authorities.  Each UI is
	  anchored to a concept report script that generates the same information that the editors
	  use to edit a concept on paper.  Use this to view or browse worklists.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>stampselect</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-stampselect">This</A> action identifies all worklists
	  (names and editors) whose
	  <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A> attribute
	  in the worklist_info table is set to 'Ready to Stamp'.  The user is presented
	  with the option of stamping one or more of these worklists via the
	  <A HREF="#action-stamp">stamp</A> action.
	  Note that if any of the worklists does not have an <A HREF="#attr-editor">editor</A>
	  assigned, this will not
	  proceed to the stamp action.  The user also has the option of delaying stamping
	  till later at night.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>stamp</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-stamp">This</A> is the action that does the stamping
	  of worklists.  All worklists to be stamped
	  must have their <A HREF="#attr-editor">editor</A> field set.
	  The stamping sets the authority and editor
	  as well as timestamp attributes for each concept in the worklist.  The editor's
	  initials are prefixed by the characters "S-".
	  The <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A>
	  attribute in worklist_info is updated to "Stamped" by the stamping subprocess.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>prestampselect</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-prestampselect">Retrieves</A> all worklists whose
	  <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">status</A> is 'Ready to Prestamp'.
	  The user has the option
	  of prestamping any combination of these worklists.  It proceeds to the
	  <A HREF="#action-prestamp">prestamp</A>
	  action, optionally for later in the night.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>prestamp</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-prestamp">This</A> action prestamps worklists.
	  The editor's initials are prefixed by "P-".
	  Worklists without an editor are assigned the initials:  P-PEN (for pending).
	  The <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A>
	  attribute in worklist_info is updated to "Stamped" by the prestamping subprocess.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>refresh</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-refresh">This</A> action refreshes the
	  <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table with new
	  worklists that may have been created.  For such new records,
	  the <A HREF="#attr-name">name</A>,
	  <A HREF="#attr-create_date">create_date</A>
	  and <A HREF="#attr-num_concepts">num_concepts</A> are set while
	  the other attributes default to null.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>clean</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-clean">This</A> is a purely administrative action
	  that removes stale state files (over 5 days old).
	  This usually results from the user initiating an action but not proceeding to completion.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>delete</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="action-delete">Another</A> administrative action that

	  worklists that no longer need to be tracked or were erroneously entered.
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H1><A NAME="worklist_info">Worklist Info Table Attributes</A></H1>

The WMS maintains a table called <EM>worklist_info</EM> that has a record for each worklist.
The records have the attributes shown in the table below:

<P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1>

<TR>
  <TH>Attribute</TH>
  <TH>Description</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>name</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-name">The</A> name of the worklist - it begins with the
	  letters "wrk" and has some indication
	  of which MID it was created in.  The suffix consists of an underscore and
	  a two digit segment number, though this is not always consistently applied.
	  Note: worklist names are usually cryptic due to a 16 character limitation for
	  table names in Ingres.  For example: wrk98e_icd10_02 refers to the second worklist
	  of ICD 10 concepts created in MID98e.
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>grp</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-grp">Worklists</A> are edited by groups of editors.
	  This attribute identifies the group that the worklist
	  has been assigned to as (usually) a short abbreviation, e.g., KEV or ECRI.  This
	  field is set by NLM (using the <A HREF="#authentication">nlmmgr</A> user ID).  The value
	  is automatically converted to uppercase.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>editor</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-editor">This</A> attribute names the specific editor
	  that edited a worklist (or a majority of
	  the concepts in a worklist).  It is assigned by the group manager of an editing group
	  and is usually a three letter abbreviation, e.g., TPW, WTH (values are automatically
	  converted to uppercase).  Note that setting this attribute has the side-effect of
	  setting the assign_date attribute to the current time.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>assign_date</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-assign_date">The</A> date a worklist was assigned to a
	  specific editor by the manager of an editing group.
	  This is automatically set in the WMS to the time when the editor attribute was set.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>return_date</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-return_date">This</A> is the date when the editor
	  has completed working on a worklist and returns the paper
	  material to NLM for review.  It is designed to be set either by the editors themselves
	  or the group manager.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>stamp_status</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-stamp_status">This</A> attribute tracks the status
	  of a worklist.  It can have one of the following values:
	  'N/A' (worklist is still being edited or has not yet been assigned), 'Not Ready' (NLM
	  has Q/A'ed the worklist and returned it back to the editor for further review,
	  'Ready to Stamp' (NLM has reviewed and accepted the work), 'Stamped' (NLM has attributed
	  the editor's authority to all the concepts in the worklist), 'Ready to Prestamp' (NLM
	  has assurance that this worklist will be edited on paper) and 'Prestamped' (NLM has
	  attributed an editor or a dummy value of PEN [pending] for this worklist).
<P>
	  When NLM sets it to 'Ready to Stamp' or 'Ready to Prestamp', the <A HREF="#actions">stampselect</A>
	  and <A HREF="#actions">prestampselect</A> actions will identify these worklists as being
	  ready for stamping or prestamping respectively.  When NLM sets the value to 'Not Ready',
	  this has the effect of setting the <EM>return_date</EM> attribute to null (or N/A).
<P>
	  The stamp_status is changed to 'Stamped' or 'Prestamped' by the <A HREF="#actions">stamp</A>
	  and <A HREF="#actions">prestamp</A> actions respectively.  Setting it to one of these
	  values manually has no effect outside the table and should not normally be done.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>stamp_date</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-stamp_date">The</A> date when this worklist was stamped
	  or prestamped.  This is set by the <A HREF="#actions">stamp</A>
	  or <A HREF="#actions">prestamp</A> actions.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>create_date</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-create_date">Date</A> when the worklist was created.
	  This is obtained from the database system catalogs by the
	  <A HREF="#action-refresh">refresh</A> action.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>num_concepts</TD>
  <TD><A NAME="attr-num_concepts">The</A> number of concepts that were in the
	  worklist at the time it was created.  This is
	  computed by the <A HREF="#action-refresh">refresh</A> action when a worklist
	  record is initialized.
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H1><A NAME="authentication">Authentication</A></H1>

The Worklist Management System (WMS) operates under the control of a WWW (HTTP) server
and relies on standard HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) mechanisms for
authenticating users.  Currently, access to the WMS is allowed by users authenticated with
the user IDs: <EM>nlmmgr</EM> and <EM>editor</EM>.  Limited access is also provided
to other users of <A HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov">MEOW</A>,
the Metathesaurus Editors' Web site.

<P>

The <EM>nlmmgr</EM> user is allowed full access to modify data in the WMS.  They are allowed
to execute all the actions, including the <A HREF="#action-stamp">stamp</A>,
<A HREF="#action-prestamp">prestamp</A>,  <A HREF="#action-refresh">refresh</A>,
<A HREF="#action-clean">clean</A>, <A HREF="#action-delete">delete</A>, etc.,
and allowed to modify the different <A HREF="#worklist_info">attributes</A> of the
worklist_info table.
The password to this user ID is only given to NLM personnel managing and tracking
the editing work.

<P>

The <EM>editor</EM> user is allowed partial edit access to data in the WMS.  They are allowed
to execute the actions <A HREF="#action-stamp">select</A> (and
<A HREF="#action-update">update</A> and can modify the
<A HREF="#attr-editor">editor</A> and <A HREF="#attr-return_date">return_date</A> attributes
of the worklist_info table.
The password to this user ID is given to all editors and the editing managers working on the
UMLS Metathesaurus.

<P>

The unauthenticated user of MEOW is allowed to query the data and examine the contents
of the worklist_info table in read-only mode.  They are also allowed to execute
the <A HREF="#action-view">view</A>
action that lets them browse a worklist down to retrieving a concept report.

<H1><A NAME="worklist_selection">Worklist Selection</A></H1>

This is the query form for the Worklist Management System.
It contains a variety of criteria for specifying which worklists are to be
retrieved.  If no criteria are specified, the result set contains all
worklists from the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table.
Each criterion reduces the result set to only those worklists that match it.
Multiple criteria implies that the result set satisfies all of them (i.e., a boolean
AND).
<P>
The checkbox in the leftmost column must first be selected to make a criterion active.
The current set of criteria are:

<P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1>

<TR>
  <TH>Criterion</TH>
  <TH>Description</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Worklist Prefix</TD>
  <TD>This is an exhaustive list of all worklist names that is constructed on-the-fly
	  from the database upto the trailing worklist number.  For example, if there
	  are three worklists named: wrk98e_msh_01, wrk98e_msh_02, wrk98e_msh_03,
	  an entry "wrk98e_msh" is added to the menu.  Selecting this criterion
	  retrieves all the worklists with this prefix.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>With Name Like</TD>
  <TD>This criterion retrieves all worklists whose names have the typed-in value
	  as a substring. In SQL terms, the search pattern is constructed as '%foo%',
	  if you typed in "foo" to retrieve all worklists whose names have the
	  string 'foo' in them.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Group</TD>
  <TD>This is a pick list of all the groups currently in the database
	  (in the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table)
	  and is retrieved
	  using a dynamic query.  The Null group is represented as N/A.  Selecting
	  a group retrieves all worklists assigned to that group.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Editor</TD>
  <TD>This is a pick list of all the editors currently in the database
	  (in the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A> table)
	  and is retrieved
	  using a dynamic query.  The Null editor is represented as N/A.  Selecting
	  an editor retrieves all worklists assigned to that editor.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Create Date Between</TD>
  <TD>This criterion can be used to restrict the <A HREF="#attr-create_date">create_date</A>
	  of worklists to be retrieved.
	  The date range is specified using two year, month, date menus, with the latter
	  date set to the current date.  The origin date is configureable in the WMS
	  system and is set to Jan 1 of the previous year.  Use this to look for
	  worklists that were created on or around a certain date.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Assign Date Between</TD>
  <TD>This criterion can be used to restrict the <A HREF="#attr-assign_date">assign_date</A>
	  of worklists to be retrieved.
	  The date range is specified using two year, month, date menus, with the latter
	  date set to the current date.  The origin date is configureable in the WMS
	  system and is set to Jan 1 of the previous year.  Use this to look for
	  worklists that were assigned to an editor on or around a certain date.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Return Date Between</TD>
  <TD>This criterion can be used to restrict the <A HREF="#attr-return_date">return_date</A>
	  of worklists to be retrieved.
	  The date range is specified using two year, month, date menus, with the latter
	  date set to the current date.  The origin date is configureable in the WMS
	  system and is set to Jan 1 of the previous year.  Use this to look for
	  worklists that were returned to NLM on or around a certain date.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Return Date is Null</TD>
  <TD>This criterion can be used to look for worklists that still haven't been returned
	  to NLM.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Stamp Status</TD>
  <TD>This criterion allows selection by the <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A>
	  attribute of the worklist_info table.  This menu allows for multiple items
	  to be selected and returns all worklists with any of the specified values.
	  The value N/A refers to a null stamp status.
  </TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>Stamp Date Between</TD>
  <TD>This criterion can be used to restrict the <A HREF="#attr-stamp_date">stamp_date</A>
	  of worklists to be retrieved.
	  The date range is specified using two year, month, date menus, with the latter
	  date set to the current date.  The origin date is configureable in the WMS
	  system and is set to Jan 1 of the previous year.  Use this to look for
	  worklists that were stamped (or prestamped) on or around a certain date.
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

There is a final checkbox for restricting the result set to worklists created
in the current database.

<H2>Example</H2>
Retrieve all worklists with group = "KEV" and return_date is null, i.e., all
worklists that are currently being edited by Kevric.  To effect this, select the
group criterion checkbox (lefmost column), select "KEV" from the group menu,
and select the checkbox for "return_date is null".  The hit the submit button
(labelled "Get Worklists") to see the result.

<H1><A NAME="matching_worklists">Matching Worklist</A></H1>

This table displays the result of a query.  Information about the matching worklists
are displayed in tabular form.  All attributes from the <A HREF="#worklist_info">worklist_info</A>
table are shown.  Some of the information in each row may be editable if the user was
<A HREF="#authentication">authenticated</A> as the user <EM>nlmmgr</EM> or <EM>editor</EM>.
For these users, there is a submit button below the table labelled "Record Changes" that
executes the <A HREF="#action-update">update</A> action and records the changes made
in the database.  The result of the update contains information on what was changed.

<P>

The "Reset Values" button undoes all the changes made in the table and restores it to its
initial state.

Whenever the name of a worklist is displayed, it is anchored to the <A HREF="#action-view">view</A>
action for that worklist that lets the user browse the worklist in read-only mode.

<H1><A NAME="worklist_selection_for_stamping">Worklist Selection for Stamping</A></H1>

When the <A HREF="#action-stampselect">stampselect</A> action is invoked,
all worklists whose <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A> is "Ready to Stamp" are
retrieved.  The diplay consists of a table with these worklists and the editor initials
and a checkbox to confirm the stamping of each worklist.  The user can deselect the
checkboxes of those worklist he/she does not want to stamp at this time.  If not all
worklists have assigned editors, the stamping process will not run and there will
not be a submit button.  In such cases, <A HREF="#action-prestamp">prestamping</A>
may be more appropriate.
<P>
Since stamping can be a database intensive process, there is the option of running the
actual stamping subprocess later in the night.  If a time of 'now' is chosen, the the
stamping process runs concurrently.  In either case, the result of submitting
the form (the Go Prestamp! button) shows the
worklists that were either stamped or will be stamped later that night.
The "Reset Values" button
initializes the checkbox selection to the default values.

<H1><A NAME="worklist_selection_for_prestamping">Worklist Selection for Prestamping</A></H1>

When the <A HREF="#action-prestampselect">prestampselect</A> action is invoked,
all worklists whose <A HREF="#attr-stamp_status">stamp_status</A> is "Ready to Prestamp" are
retrieved.  The diplay consists of a table with these worklists and the editor initials
and a checkbox to confirm the prestamping of each worklist.  The user can deselect the
checkboxes of those worklist he/she does not want to prestamp at this time.  If the editor
is not specified, the initials "PEN" (for "pending") are assigned.
<P>
Since prestamping can be a database intensive process, there is the option of running the
actual prestamping subprocess later in the night.  If a time of 'now' is chosen, the the
prestamping process runs concurrently.  In either case, the result of submitting
the form (the Go Prestamp! button) shows the
worklists that were either prestamped or will be prestamped later that night.
The "Reset Values" button
initializes the checkbox selection to the default values.

<H1><A NAME="worklist_information_refresh">Worklist Information Refresh</A></H1>

This page shows the names of all the (newly created) worklists for which records
