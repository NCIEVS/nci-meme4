<H1>Progress from Last Release</H1>

This analysis shows the progress made to date relative
to the last release.  It shows the size of the Metathesaurus
if it were released today.

<P>

The plot show the number of 'R' concepts in the last release
(in blue) and in the current MID (in red) over time.

<P>

Note that this is work in progress.  Still to do: better
scaling of the plots and handling of the <EM>tobereleased</EM>
attribute.
