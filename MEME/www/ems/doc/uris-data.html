<H1>Generating Data for URIS</H1>

<A HREF="/cgi-bin/uris.pl">URIS</A> (UMLS Release Information System)
displays summary data from a release and across releases of the UMLS. 
This document describes how to generate the data that is used by URIS
after a release has been made.

<P>

The script /site/umls/release/post-release.pl is the master script
that calls on other scripts (in /site/umls/release).  It is designed to
be run in parallel on multiple machines.  Here are its options:

<DL>

<P>
<DT>-m &lt;metadir&gt;
<DD>The path to the META directory for a release, e.g., /d3/Release/2002AA/META.
This can be a local path if you have unpacked the data locally or a NFS mounted
path such as /net/smis/aux/d3/Release/2002AA/META which enables the script to
be run remotely with NFS access to the data files.

<P>
<DT>-q &lt;qadir&gt;
<DD>The path to the QA directory for a release, e.g., /d3/Release/QA/2002AA.
All QA data used by URIS are archived on smis in /d3/Release/QA/$VERSION.
Again, this can be a local or NFS mounted path.

<P>
<DT>-t &lt;tmpdir&gt;
<DD>The path to a temporary directory.  Ideally this should be local to
the machine that the script is being run on. /tmp is the default.

<P>
<DT>-v &lt;VERSION&gt;
<DD>The version of the Metathesaurus, e.g., 2002AA.  Refer to
<A HREF="release-naming.html">this document</A> for the naming convention.

<P>
<DT>-P
<DD>A flag that says to report progress on STDERR (note this is the
capital 'P' flag).

<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>
NOTE: All URIS scripts understand the above options.  The following are
specific to the post-release.pl script.
</FONT>

<P>
<DT>-T
<DD>The top directory where releases are stored.  The default is:
/net/smis/aux/d3/Release.

<P>
<DT>-n &lt;script numbers&gt;
<DD>This option indicates which scripts to run (see the -r flag).
The numbers are comma separated.  Ranges can be specified with a
hyphen.  Example, 2,3,5-8.  If the option is omitted, the script
will run the first un-run sub script.

<P>
<DT>-e
<DD>This flag forces the sub script to exit immediately if the
output file (in the QA directory) exists.  The default is to
overwrite it.

<P>
<DT>-r
<DD>This flag produces a list of all the subscripts and their numbers.
This is useful if you plan to run on several machines in parallel.

</DL>

<H1>How to Run</H1>

<UL>

<P><LI>Decide which machine(s) will be used.  Some of the more intensive scripts will benefit
from having a copy of the Metathesaurus locally installed.  Unpack a copy locally if necessary.
The output (in the -q option) has to be on smis via a automount path (/net/smis...).

<P><LI>Decide which script(s) will be run on which machine(s).  The -r
option will tell you the numbers.  Or you can run first-come-first-served without the -n option.
The -r option will give the script numbers:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/uris-qa-generator.pl -m /tmp/2002AA/META -v 2002AA -r -q .

</PRE>
</FONT>

For example, we will run on machines smis, ob, oc and mrd. smis will run scripts 4 and 5 while the
rest will run in FIFO mode.  ob, oc and mrd have the release unpacked in /tmp.

<P><LI>Run the script for real (or via cron) as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

On smis:

/site/umls/release/uris-qa-generator.pl -m /d3/Release/2002AA/META -v 2002AA
    -q /d3/Release/QA/2002AA
    -n 4,5

On ob, oc and mrd:

/site/umls/release/uris-qa-generator.pl -m /tmp/2002AA/META -v 2002AA
    -q /net/smis/aux/d3/Release/QA/2002AA

</PRE>
</FONT>

This could run for a while.  The more machines that can run in parallel,
the better, obviously.

<P><LI>As the scripts complete, the data should become available on URIS.
