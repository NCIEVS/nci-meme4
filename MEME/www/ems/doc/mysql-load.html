<H1>Loading Release Data into MySQL</H1>

Once a release is made, it can be loaded into a MySQL database running
on the machine with the name: release.nlm.nih.gov.  This is currently
a PC running Linux.  This database version of the release can be used
for Q/A.

<P>
Here are the steps:
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>The staging area for the release data is in release:~suresh/UMLS.
Create a directory there for the current release, e.g., 2002AA,
and unpack the entire release (from CD or FTP'ed from wthsun)
into this directory.

<P><LI>The perl scripts to create the load scripts (using meta data in MRFILES, etc)
are in /site/umls/mysql/scripts/meta2mysql.pl and net2mysql.pl.
Examine the scripts to ensure that the right fields will be indexed, etc.
Note that the STY/RL and the STN/RTN fields in SRDEF have been changed to STYRL
and STNRTN resp (use the describe command in MySQL to see the table descriptions).

<P><LI>Create the load scripts on a machine with access to /site and
to the release files (say via NFS).  Smis, wthsun or astra all work.
Save the resulting SQL to the conventional names: &lt;version&gt;-{meta|net|cui}.sql
Here's how:

<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
/site/umls/mysql/scripts/meta2mysql.pl
			-m &lt;path to the META directory&gt;
			-f &lt;relative path to the META directory for the load&gt;

/site/umls/mysql/scripts/net2mysql.pl
			-m &lt;path to the NET directory&gt;
			-f &lt;relative path to the NET directory for the load&gt;

/site/umls/mysql/scripts/cui2mysql.pl
			-m &lt;path to the CHANGE directory&gt;
			-f &lt;relative path to the CHANGE directory for the load&gt;

Example:

meta2mysql.pl -m /d3/Release/$VERSION/META -f ../$VERSION/META > $VERSION-meta.sql
net2mysql.pl  -m /d3/Release/$VERSION/NET  -f ../$VERSION/NET  > $VERSION-net.sql
cui2mysql.pl  -m /d3/Release/$VERSION/META/CHANGE  -f ../$VERSION/META/CHANGE  > $VERSION-cui.sql

</FONT>

</PRE>

The relative path in the -f option is used by the mysql loader to find the relevant
MR* file.  It is specified relative to the "load" subdirectory.

<P><LI>Now you are ready to load into the MySQL database (ensure it is up and running).
Create the database, e.g.,

<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
% mysql -h release -u meow -p
mysql> drop database $UMLSVERSION;
mysql> create database $UMLSVERSION;
</FONT>
</PRE>

<P><LI>Then load the data with:

<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
% mysql -h release -u meow -p $UMLSVERSION < $UMLSVERSION-meta.sql > $UMLSVERSION-meta.log
% mysql -h release -u meow -p $UMLSVERSION < $UMLSVERSION-net.sql > $UMLSVERSION-net.log
% mysql -h release -u meow -p $UMLSVERSION < $UMLSVERSION-cui.sql > $UMLSVERSION-cui.log
</FONT>
</PRE>

The load could take a while.  Examine the log file for errors.
Note: for the CUI load (MERGED.CUI, etc.), you may need to create a symbolic link to the
AMBIG.LUI and AMBIG.SUI files since these are now not in the CHANGE directory, but in META.
E.g.,

<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
% cd /home/sureshUMLS/2002AB/META/CHANGE
% ln -s ../AMBIG.LUI
% ln -s ../AMBIG.SUI
</FONT>
</PRE>

<P><LI> There is an additional database called LVG_indexes that has these tables
for every release: $VERSION_lstr (lowercased strings), $VERSION_nstr (normalized strings)
$VERSION_lwd (lowercased word), $VERSION_nwd (normalized word).  The normalized tables
have to be create with the <EM>current</EM> norm and this has to be done on a different
machine than umls-release since a Linux based norm is not currently available.
<P>

The staging area for this is /aux/UMLS/lvg-indexes on umls-release.
If norm has not changed (as for the quarterly releases), then the
script make-files.pl will make the necessary files from the release.
Once the files above are created, the script load-files.pl will load it
into the database.

<P><LI> The release database is then available for Q/A and querying, e.g.,

<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
% echo "select * from MRCON where CUI='C0002344'" | mysql -h release -u meow -p 2002AA
</FONT>
</PRE>

This can be done from any machine with the mysql client and access to the MySQL
database on release.nlm.nih.gov.
