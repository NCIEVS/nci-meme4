<H1>MeSH-Centric Mappings from the UMLS Metathesaurus for Use in Pubmed</H1>

This document describes the steps (and the tools) used to extract
information from the UMLS Metathesaurus release files for use in the
Pubmed system.

<H1>1. Subset the Metathesaurus</H1>

<P>
@@ Do this on a separate machine (e.g. wthsun) then copy the subset, log,  and
   config files to smis directory e.g. /d3/Pubmed/2002AC/METASUBSET/, /d3/Pubmed/2002AC/mmsys.config, /d3/Pubmed/2002AC/mmsys.log

We start with a subset of the UMLS Metathesaurus (created using
MetamorphoSys) that removes the following sources:

ICPCFRE ICPCGER ICPCHUN ICPCITA ICPCNOR ICPCPOR ICPCSPA ICPCSWE INS99
ITA99 LNC10J RUS99 WHOFRE WHOGER WHOPOR WHOSPA
</PRE>

<P>
@@The cuurent rule is to exclude all foreign languages; CPT and CDT are
also excluded because NLM does not have the right to use those sources
for other than research purposes.  The CPT and CDT versions in HCPCS must
be excluded (they are shown as part of the families).

<P>
"MTH" was the preferred source and these termgroups were marked as
suppressible:

Run the MetamorphoSys system configured as above and create a subset
of the Metathesaurus, say in /d3/Release/1999/Meta-subset
<P>
NOTE: Please remember to use the current version of the source and
termgroups, e.g., CPT99 should be CPT00 in Meta 2000.
<P>
**2000

Run the MetamorphoSys "out-of-the-box".  For 2000, this excludes
all sources with SRL>0 and has default list of suppressible termgroups
(see MRRANK).
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>
We have license to use HCPCS, but not the portions of it
that are CPT and CDT(?).  Excluding CPT and CDT and including HCPCS
in MetamorphoSys should do the right thing.  Check with Bill.

<H1>1.5 Blow away "suppressible" synonyms</H1>

We never did this before but maybe this should be done?  Basically
from the subsetted MRCON, remove rows that have TS='s' (little 's').
Here's one way:

<H1>2. Extract Synonymy (SY file)</H1>

For every concept in the UMLS Metathesaurus that contains a MeSH
"main" term (i.e., terms with the term type (TTY) of MH, NM, TQ, GQ
and LQ), atoms (strings) from all relevant sources are extracted
from MRCON using the script /site/umls/pubmed/sy.sh as follows:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/pubmed/sy.sh -d /d3/Release/1999/Meta-subset -s MSH99 &gt; sy.out.041499

'entry' term (same MeSH code and source).  Self-referential

term is included.  As with the SY file, suppressible and non-English
synonymys are eliminated.

<P><LI>Is there a synonym in the SY file that is lowercase identical to

The mm.new.this version file contains the cases which APPEARED since
the last version - these cases will cause multiple retrievals by
mapping to multiple MeSH "main" terms and should be fixed by adding
the incorrect cases to the not-sy file (see below).
<P>


<H1>4. The "not-sy" file</H1>

This provides a mechanism to block a mapping.   This file contains
pairs of strings (case and order do not matter) that should not map
together.  For example, since "ventilation" in MeSH does not mean
"respiration", this file could have:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
ventilation|respiration
</PRE>

<P>

The final step in this process (program final.pl) will assimilate this
fact and disable this mapping.

If additional mappings are desired beyond that provided in the SY and
RT files, it can be stated here.

** ORDER in this file does matter **

<H1>5.5 Create additional British spelling variants</H1>

In smis:/d3/Pubmed/brit.amer.map is a file containing
British->American word level mappings.  This file is used to generate
British spelling for terms in the SY, RT and add-sy files.  All
permutations of multi-word terms are generated.  For example, "armor
ameba" will generate the forms: "armour ameba", "armour amoeba" and
"armour amoeba".  In addition, Britishisms are generated for the MeSH
Main headings themselves and the additional synonymy file.

To generate the British forms, use:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/pubmed/brit.pl -b &lt; brit-amer map &gt; -s &lt;SY file&gt; -r &lt;RT file&gt; -a &lt;add-sy&gt; -n &lt;not-sy&gt; &gt; add-brit.&lt;YYMMDD&gt;
</PRE>

</FONT>

i.e., it is passed the paths to the SY, RT, "add-sy" and "not-sy"
files.  The last two are optional.  It produces 3 fields of data:
the MeSH term, the "synonym" with the American spelling and the
Britishized synonym.  The second field is there for informational
purposes and is not used in the final stage.


<H1>6. The final step</H1>

This is the last step in producing pairs of MeSH-centric synonyms from
Meta.  The script /site/umls/pubmed/final.pl is run as follows:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
/site/umls/pubmed/final.pl -s &lt;SY file&gt; -r &lt;RT file&gt; -a &lt;add-sy&gt; -n &lt;not-sy&gt; -b &lt;brit&gt; &gt; final.out.041499
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>

i.e., it is passed the paths to the SY, RT, "add-sy" and "not-sy" and
British files.  The last three are optional.  It produces pairs of
synonymous lowercase strings.  The output is pairs of equivalent
strings in this MeSH world view.  The strings are lowercased and in
sort order within the pair.  The file itself is in sort order.

<P>

All statements of synonymous mapping are filtered through the pairs in
the "not-sy" file.  Thus, if a pairing is present both in the "not-sy"
and the "add-sy" file, the "not-sy" statement wins.

<P> The script can be run with the -d (for debug) option to diagnose
problems.  In this mode, it outputs the two equivalent strings,
followed by "SY", "RT", "AS" or "BR" and the line from the matching
file (SY, RT, add-sy, brit).  It also prints messages to standard
error showing which mappings were blocked due to facts in the "not-sy"
file.

<H1>7. Running this system</H1>

Once the SY and RT files are created from the last release, these stay
unchanged.  Only the "add-sy" and the "not-sy" and "brit" files need
be edited/generated, although the sources of problems may be found in
the SY and RT files using the grep command.  For example, if "foo" is
incorrectly matching "bar", run the final.pl script with the -d option
and use grep as follows:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
  grep '^bar|foo|' &lt;file&gt;
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>

Note that the output of final.pl is sorted so that "bar" sorts before
"foo".

<P>
The MM file can be created and examined for spurious matching.  These
"non-synonyms" are entered in the non-synonym file which can have
comments (leading #) and blank lines for readability.  This file
should be maintained and kept current and is fed forward into the
processing for next year.  Any additional "must-have" synonymy should
be entered into the "add-sy" file that should also be maintained.

<P>
Once the "add-sy" and "not-sy" files are current, the final.pl script
can be run (as often as desired) to obtain the new list of mappings.
