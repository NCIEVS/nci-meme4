<H1>Naming Releases</H1>

This document specifies the convention for the naming of UMLS releases.
Note that the convention was adopted in 2001 so previous releases will
not follow these rules.

<P>

A release name follows the format: YYYYVV where:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>YYYY is a 4 digit year, e.g., 2001
<LI>VV is a two letter designation for the version ID starting with "AA", e.g., 2001AA
</UL>

<P>

The first release of the year will have the version ID of "AA".
Subsequent releases for that year will have a version ID of "AB", "AC", etc.
<P>
When errors are discovered in a release, a revised version of the release
is made available.  The revised version has a two digit revision ID appended
to the release name.  A <EM>base</EM> release is a release before any revisions
are made.

<P>
Examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>2001AA -> First release for 2001
<LI>2002AC_02 -> second revision of the third release (AC) in 2002
<LI>2020GD_78 (hope we don't get to this!)
</UL>

The releases are distributed as compressed files (ZIP and TGZ) whose names
are constructed as follows: release name followed by a single digit disc ID
with the file extension "ZIP" or "TGZ" for the ZIP and TGZ formats respectively.
For example:

<P>
<UL> 
<LI>2004AB_1.ZIP (2004AB release, first disc, ZIP compression)
<LI>2004AB_2.ZIP (2004AB release, second disc, ZIP compression)
<LI>2005AA_1.TGZ (2005AA release, first disc, TGZ compression)
<LI>2005AA_2.TGZ (2005AA release, second disc, TGZ compression)<
<LI>2005AA_3.TGZ (2005AA release, third disc, TGZ compression)
</UL>
  
<H2>Compressed file names for Revisions</H2>

With revisions, there are two kinds of compressed files, one containing only
the changes accumulated since the base release and the other containing all
the sequentially applied revisions from a base release.  The letters "C" and
"F" are used to designate the revision type, standing for "change" and "full".
The compressed files will have with a "C" preceding the revision ID, e.g.,

<P>
<UL>
<LI>2002AA_1_C01.ZIP (2002AA release; first compressed ZIP file; change only; first rev)
<LI>2004AA_2_C03.TGZ (2004AA release; second compressed TGZ file; change only; third rev)
<LI>2005AB_1_F01.ZIP (2005AB release; first compressed ZIP file; full release; first rev)
<LI>2005AB_2_F01.ZIP (2005AB release; second compressed ZIP file; full release; first rev)
</UL>
<P>

A change release is unpacked in the same top level directory as a previously
downloaded base release.  It will overwrite the revised files.
<P>
Once unpacked however, the top level directory will have the name of the
base release, i.e., the name without the revision ID.  Note that
file timestamps are distinct for each revision.

<H1>Disc Names</H1>

As of Nov 2003, the release is sent to users that requested it on 2 CDs.
The names of the disc follow a similar convention: release name followed
by single digit disc ID, followed optionally by the revision type indicator
and revision ID, and then by "_ZIP" or "_TAR" for the ZIP and TGZ versions
respectively.  For example,

<P>
<UL>
<LI>2003AB_1_ZIP (2003AB release; first disc; ZIP compression)
<LI>2004AA_2_F02_TAR (2004AA release, second disc, full second revision; TGZ compression)
</UL>  

<P>

These longer names run afoul of the ISO9660 naming convention but will
be Joliet compliant.
