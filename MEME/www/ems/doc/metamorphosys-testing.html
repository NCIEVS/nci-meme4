<H1>MetamorphoSys Testing</H1>

At this point, the full release files have successfully passed all your Q/A.
<P>
<EM>MetamorphoSys</EM> is a program used for customizing the Metathesaurus and
satisfying licensing requirements.  This needs to be tested on a variety
of platforms (Solaris, Windows-NT and Windows-2000, Windows-98, Windows-ME, and Linux).

<P>

MetamorphoSys is tested from the ZIP and TAR files made from the master2dist.pl
script.  The ZIP contains the NT/Windows version while the TAR (TGZ) contains
the UNIX/Linux versions.  The following tests need to be done.
Check the README.MMS file that comes with the distribution on how to run
MetamorphoSys.

<H2>1. Run the default MetamorphoSys</H2>

The default MetamorphoSys excludes all sources with restriction level>0.
The result is a Metathesaurus that is unencumbered by any licence restriction.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Run the default MetamorphoSys on Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X and NT
<P>
<LI>ZIP (tar) the result, FTP to a single machine (smis:/d3/Release/MMS-comparisons/$VERSION).
Compare the different versions with compare-meta.pl:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/compare-meta.pl -1 Solaris-default-subset.tgz -2 NT-default-subset.ZIP -d 2
/site/umls/release/compare-meta.pl -1 Solaris-default-subset.tgz -2 linux-default-subset.ZIP

</PRE>

<P>
As before, look for errors in the output.  MRCOLS, MRFILES are typically different
across the DOS/UNIX divide.  And mmsys.log will be different, if present.
<P>
<LI>
Then examine the subsetted Metathesaurus.  For example, is all resulting content level 0
(the 8th field of MRCON and the 7th field of MRSO should be 0).  Spot check a few known
examples where you know there is restricted content.
<P>
<LI>
You can and should run all the scripted QA scripts on the subset, e.g.,
cuiqa.pl, format-qa.pl and sort-check.pl.
</UL>

<H2>2. More Extensive Testing, Debugging</H2>

You should verify things like:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Are all the sources in MRSO (and other MR files with SAB like columns, e.g., MRLO)
	present in the config files (source.txt)?
<P>
<LI>The sources.to.remove file is created by using the starred lines in source.txt.
Do the lines in source.txt with a leading '*' contain only non-level 0 sources?
These are also the sources that are first highlighted in the GUI as sources that will
be removed.
<P>
<LI>Does prec.order look right?  Termgroups with the highest precedence should be
at the top of the file.  Is MTH/PN on the first line?
<P>
<LI>Do the lines with a leading '*' in prec.order look like suppressible
termgroups?
<P>
<LI>Is the README.MMS file accurate and correct?  We are responsible for
this.
<P>
<LI>Does the mmsys.properties file look right?
</UL>


<H2>3. Non-default Subsetting</H2>
You should run MetamorphoSys in other ways.  I check the boundary conditions of
removing ALL sources and removing NO source.  You can also try removing a single
source and using grep on the result for that SAB in all the MR files.
The results should be intuitive.
<P>
You should also test the changing of the naming precedence and addition
of more source/term-types to the default suppressible set.  Then examine the
output and satisfy yourself that what was intended did in fact happen.
Time permitting, try this on all platforms.

<H2>4. A small Meta for testing MetamorphoSys logic</H2>
Since it takes so long to run MetatmorphoSys on the full Metathesaurus, the
script /site/umls/release/make-small-meta.pl takes an input of CUIs and
makes a small Metathesaurus that contains those concepts and all other concepts
linked to them (say via MRREL, MRCXT, etc).  I find this useful for testing.
There is a pre-made "small" meta in smis:/d3/Release/sample-Meta.

<H2>5. What if something goes wrong?</H2>
If you discover error in the output of MetamorphoSys, notify Apelon at once.
After they send you the fix, you get to re-test starting from Step 1.
Boo! Hiss!!
