<H1>ems-post-backup.pl</H1>

This script resides in /site/umls/scripts and is the entry point for
EMS functions that need to be performed after a machine reboots or the
DBMS functionality is restored after a backup.  It also is used to
start MEME and LVG services on all machines that need this.
<P>
It is typically called from the /etc/AutoDump/make_ready_for_nlm.s
script after Oracle is available (with the -lme options).
It has to run with root privileges.
The script is also called with the -l option (to start LVG services)
after the editing-db MID service is changed.
<P>
It prints status messages to STDERR as it progresses.

<H1>Options</H1>
The script has the following options (one of 'l', 'm', or 'e' is
required, otherwise the script does nothing):
<UL>

<P><LI>-g<BR>
Just print the actions without doing them.  Useful for debugging.

<P><LI>-m<BR>
Re-start the MEME server on this machine.  This brings up
the MEME server if this machine is one named by MID service
like meme-server-host*.  The MEME start up script is expected
in /etc/init.d/meme_server and it has to support the 'restart' option.

<P><LI>-l<BR>
Re-start LVG servers.  The algorithm to start LVG servers is this:
a) Start one locally if named in MID services like lvg-server-host*
b) Start one remotely (using rsh) on all hosts named by MID services
like lvg-server-host* if machine is named by the 'editing-db' MID
service.  The LVG startup script is expected in /etc/init.d/lvg_server
and it has to support the 'restart' option.

<P><LI>-e<BR>
Run all EMS-related initialization, e.g., Matrix initialization,
CUI assignment, ME bins repartitioning, etc.
