<H1><A NAME="1">CGI Parameters</A></H1>
The EMS (and the WMS) take parameters as CGI arguments that control what action
is taken.  CGI arguments can be given as part of the URL following the '?'
(e.g., http://meow/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl<B>?</B>db=oa_mid2001) or as part
of a form.  The current list of CGI params are (shown in bold are generic to
EMS and WMS):
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>service=</B>
<DD>This tells the EMS which MID service to use to determine which database to
connect to.  Either the service= or db= parameter can be used (not both).  The
default is to use the MID service: current-editing-tns.
<DT><B>db=</B>
<DD>This tells the EMS which database to use.  It is preferable to use the
service= parameter, but the db= parameter works.  The defalt database is
the database returned by the MID service current-editing-tns.
<DT>action=
<DD>These describe specific actions performed by the EMS.  The default action
is to display the EMS home page.  Allowed actions are (this list may be
incomplete, see the ems.pl source for the current list):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>home (display home page),
<LI>db (change database), 
<LI>access (change access restrictions),
<LI>me_bins (show current ME bin partitioning), 
<LI>me_repartition (do ME bin partitioning),
<LI>me_repartition_log (show the log of ME bin partitioning), 
<LI>me_refresh (refresh the counts of an ME bin), 
<LI>me_checklist (make a checklist from an ME bin),
<LI>me_worklist (make a worklist from an ME bin), 
<LI>ah_bins (show current AH bin list and count), 
<LI>ah_generate (generate the contents of an AH bin), 
<LI>ah_refresh (refresh the counts of an AH bin), 
<LI>ah_checklist (make an AH checklist), 
<LI>ah_worklist (make an AH worklist), 
<LI>qa_bins (show current list of QA bins and counts), 
<LI>qa_generate (generate the contents of a QA bin), 
<LI>qa_refresh (refresh the counts of a QA bin), 
<LI>qa_checklist (make a QA checklist), 
<LI>qa_worklist (make a QA worklist), 
<LI>matrixinit (run the matrixinit in catchup mode), 
<LI>matrixinitlog (display the log of a matrix init run), 
<LI>epoch (change the current editing epoch), 
<LI>daily_report (show daily editing report), 
<LI>bin_history (show data for previous bin epochs), 
<LI>assigncuis (run the CUI assignment program), 
<LI>assigncuislog (view the log of the CUI assignment program), 
<LI>viewfile (a helper action), 
<LI>cutoff (sets the DBA cutoff), 
<LI>table_help (show table help info), 
<LI>rptstats (shows fun statistics for concept reports), 
<LI>activity (shows the tail of EMS activity)

<H1><A NAME="2">Stamping</A></H1>
Worklists are "stamped" by NLM after passing quality assurance (QA) checks.  This implies
batch approval of concepts on the worklist on behalf of the editor to whom it
was assigned.  However, not all concepts on a worklist undergo the approval process.
If there is newly merged content (status=N) since the worklist was created, or if the
concept was recently approved in the editing interface, the concept is recycled for re-edit.
<P>
To re-iterate, a concept on a worklist is <EM>NOT</EM> stamped if:

<UL>
<LI> <CODE>concept_status.editing_timestamp</CODE> is more recent than &lt;worklist&gt;<CODE>.create_date</CODE>, or
<LI> there is a new, i.e., more recent 'N' status atom, attribute or relationship in the concept, or
<LI> there is a new, i.e., more recent 'U' status atom in the concept, or
<LI> concept does not currently exist, i.e., has been merged
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="3">Epochs</A></H1>
What are "epochs"?  An epoch is an interval of time that marks the editing of one or
more sources.  In a sense this is an arbitrary time period, but has many implications
as noted below.  An epoch is a 3 character string, the first two are digits signifying
the release year followed by an alphabetic character, increasing from 'a' through 'z', e.g.,
99a, 00d, etc.  Epochs past and current are recorded in the
<A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_current_editing_epoch&owner=MEOW">
ems_current_editing_epoch</A> table.
<P>
All worklist names are prefixed by the letters, 'wrk' followed by the epoch in which they
were created.  This enables us to tell at a glance roughly when a worklist was extant,
e.g., wrk01c_missyn_nc_12.  The EMS has an action to change the epoch.
<P>
As a rule of thumb you want to change epochs after one or more "major" source insertions.
We have roughly 3 or 4 epochs during an editing cycle (year).
Here are the implications of changing epochs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Worklist created henceforth will have names with a different prefix
<LI>Worklist numbers for <EM>ALL</EM> bins will be reset to 1
<LI>An active entry is recorded in the ems_current_bin_epoch table
<LI>For AH bins, there is a notion of global and local history.  Local history is
	intra-epoch while global history is across all epochs.
<LI>The WMS query menu will change (only active epochs shown)
<LI>A subdirectory for this epoch will be created in /d3/ems/reports when a report is generated
<LI>A ZIP file is created in /d3/ems/worklists for this epoch to store raw worklist data
<LI>Many of these changes are hard to reverse, so please use this carefully!
<LI>A new bin_epoch will be started in ems_bin_info for all types of bins
</UL>
