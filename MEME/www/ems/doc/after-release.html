<H1>Things to do After Making a Release</H1>

This is a checklist of things to do after a release is made.
In the following, $UMLSVERSION is the name of the release, e.g.,
2002AA, $LVGVERSION is the name of the current LVG release, e.g.,
lvg2002.

<UL>

<P><LI>
On smis, unpack the distribution from the TAR file into: /d3/Release/$UMLSVERSION,
e.g., /d3/Release/2002AA.  If space is a problem, store it in /d4/UMLS/Release but make
sure there is a link from /d3/Release.

<P><LI>
Edit the file smis:/d3/Release/config/release.dat and add a row containing
information about this release.

<P><LI>Create the directory: smis:/d3/Release/QA/$UMLSVERSION

<P><LI>There is now a script called /site/umls/release/post-release.pl that runs all
the scripts for Q/A.  The results are used by the URIS system.
This script is described <A HREF="uris-data.html">here</A>.

<P><LI>Load the new release <A HREF="mysql-load.html">into MySQL</A>.

<P><LI>
If this UMLS version has a new release of LVG, install it on umls-release in ~suresh/LVG
(This should be a Linux install without MySQL or Oracle databases, just IDB).
See here for <A HREF="new-lvg.html">information on how to install LVG</A>.

<P><LI> There is a MySQL database called LVG_indexes that contains
lowercase and luiNorm'ed string and word indexes for the strings in
the new release.  On umls-release, there is a perl script that will
create this data from the MRCON table and load it into the MySQL
database.  The script is /aux/UMLS/lvg-indexes/recompute-lvg-indexes.pl and
should be run with the -v $UMLSVERSION option for the current version.
<P>
If this is a new LVG release, you want to recompute the LVG_indexes tables
for all prior releases using the new LVG.  Use the -a option to do this.
This will take a while to run (few hours per release).
<P>

This reason for this database is it is needed for meow concept reports.  The MRX*
files that come with the release are computed with <EM>norm</EM>
whereas searching in the MID and meow is done with <EM>luinorm</EM>
and so are different.

<P>

Finally, you should also create the data on smis if you still
need the old style access.  This can be done by running the
script in smis:/d3/Release/lvg-indexes/recompute-lvg-indexes.pl.
It should create the luinorm-based MRX* files for this release
in smis:/d3/Release/lvg-indexes/$LVGVERSION/luinorm/$METAVERSION.

<P><LI>
Update the documentation in umlsinfo.nlm.nih.gov.  In particular:
<OL>
<LI>Generate MySQL load scripts (see /site/umls/mysql/scripts) and put these
on umlsinfo.
<LI>Put the METAMSYS/doc contents on umlsinfo
<LI>Put README_MMS on umlsinfo.
</OL>

<P>
<LI> The script /site/umls/release/srdef2rela.pl generates the SRDEF table (with supplementary information)
from the SRDEF file in the Semantic Network.  This needs to be run by Vladimir on the new release.
Check with him.

<P>
<LI> We run the software to create the Pubmed mapping file for SJN (nelson@nlm).
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="pubmed.usernotes.txt">User notes</A>
<LI>More detail from the <A HREF="pubmed.readme.html">README</A> file.
</UL>
<P>Send mail to Stuart once this is done.

<P><LI>
Make a small Metathesaurus packaged with the current MetamorphoSys for testing and
demonstration.  The script is in smis:/d3/Release/small-meta/pack.pl.

<P><LI>
Create a full subset (i.e., no sources removed) using MetamorphoSys
and using the Oracle output stream.  This will create the data and control
files along with a script to run to load into the Oracle database (editing-db).
The user name for this is 'reluser' with the default table space of
'RELEASE'.  Make sure there are public synonyms for the tables.
Here's how.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy the subsetted files over to oa (or run MMSYS on oa
to begin with) since the loader has to run locally.
<LI>The MMSYS output includes .dat and .ctl files for each MR file, some
SQL files and a shell script (populate_oracle_db.csh) that needs to
be edited thus:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the ORACLE_HOME, user, password and TNS name in the shell
script.
<LI>I add the following code at the end of the script
(before the "Finished" message).  It basically grants privileges
to all the users on the newly loaded MR tables and creates
public synonyms for them.

<PRE>

foreach f (*.ctl)
  set b=`echo $f|sed 's/\..*$//'`
  echo "Granting permissions and creating synonym for $b"
  echo "GRANT ALL ON $b TO PUBLIC;"|$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus -s $user/$password@$tns_name
  echo "DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM $b;"|$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus -s $user/$password@$tns_name
  echo "CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM $b FOR reluser.$b;"|$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus -s $user/$password@$tns_name
end

</PRE>

</OL>

<LI>We are currently loading only on the production DB on oa (oa_mid2004, for example).

<LI>When loaded, change the permissions on the shell script to
770 (world has no privileges) or remove the entire directory.

</UL>

<P>
<LI> There is a file of current STY's on meow /export/home/meow/styfile.html.
	This is generated by feeding the latest SRDEF file to the script:
	/site/umls/scripts/srdef2html.pl.  But first, you can pull out a file
	containing all the chemical STYs.  Here are the steps:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -q "SELECT semantic_type from semantic_types where editing_chem='Y'" > /tmp/chem.types
/site/umls/scripts/srdef2html.pl -c /tmp/chem.types &lt; /d3/Release/UMLS2001/NET/SRDEF &gt; /tmp/styfile.html

</PRE>
</FONT>

	Save the old version of styfile.html on meow and then copy this version to meow.
	Test to make ensure it looks OK.
