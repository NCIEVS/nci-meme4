<H1>EMS/WMS tables</H1>

The tables where the EMS and WMS information is stored in the database
is in the MEOW schema and have the prefix <EM>ems_</EM> or <EM>wms_</EM>.
Here is the current list:

<P>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_me_bins&owner=MEOW">ems_me_bins</A>
<DD>One row for every concept and the name of the ME bin it's in.
	This is cleared and renewed with each repartition.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_qa_bins&owner=MEOW">ems_qa_bins</A>
<DD>When a QA bin is regenerated, its rows are cleared from this table
	and the new content inserted.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_ah_bins&owner=MEOW">ems_ah_bins</A>
<DD>When an AH bin is regenerated, its rows are cleared from this table
	and the new content inserted.
<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_bin_info&owner=MEOW">ems_bin_info</A>
<DD>This is where all the information about every bin is stored.  This includes the information from the
	configuration file as well as historical information (counts, etc.)

<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_being_edited&owner=MEOW">ems_being_edited</A>
<DD>This table contains a row for every concept that is out on a worklist, along with the worklist name.
	This is cleared when the worklist is stamped or marked as "done".
<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_ah_canonical_bin&owner=MEOW">ems_ah_canonical_bin</A>
<DD>AH bins have history that is key'ed on the bin name.  This table allows bins that share
	history to have different names. It maps an AH bin name to its canonical name, e.g.,
	needsrel, needsrels, etc. all map to needsrel.

<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_checklist_info&owner=MEOW">ems_checklist_info</A>
<DD>This table holds information about checklists: who created it, when, etc.

<P>
<DT><A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=wms_worklist_info&owner=MEOW">wms_worklist_info</A>
<DD>This table holds all information about worklists and is maintained by the WMS.

</DL>

You can use the EMS table_help feature on meow to get more information about these and other
tables.

<H1>How ME bins work</H1>

See <A HREF="/ems/doc/me_bins.html">EMS documentation</A> for full information.

<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Configuration file specifies the bins and their ordering
<P><LI>Generation of concepts that meet the bin criteria (source, demotions, etc.)
<P><LI>Concepts inserted into <A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=ems_me_bins&owner=MEOW">ems_me_bins</A> in order
<P><LI>When worklists or checklists are made in the EMS concepts are drawn from the bin.
	They are clustered and ordered before being passed to make-checklist.pl or make-worklist.pl.
<P><LI>There are two scripts for each editable bin: generation and ordering
<P><LI>Notion of generation and refreshing counts: For ME bins, generation is done by
	repartitioning which empties the ems_me_bins table and repopulates it for
	each ME bin in order.  Refreshing counts basically takes the concepts in
	an ME bin, runs it through the ordering script and counts the resulting concepts,
	clusters, etc.  As worklists are made these counts change.
<P><LI>Clusters are eliminated from going out on worklists if a concept in the
      cluster is:

	<P>
	<OL>
	  <LI>an embryo
	  <LI>is out on another worklist
	  <LI>is currently in R status
	  <LI>does not currently exist, i.e., has been merged
	</OL>

	<P>
      these collectively form the class of "Uneditable" concepts.
      The rest are counted as "Editable".
<P><LI>Bins can be configured to be split into chemical and non-chemical.  This is
	controlled by the script: cnc-split.pl which looks at the
	<A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=semantic_types&owner=MTH">semantic_types</A>.editing_chem
<P><LI>Some ME bins are pre-configured and <EM>should not be changed</EM>.  You can create
	editable bins (as many as you need) and specify the ordering in the configuration
	file.
</UL>

<H1>HOW are concepts for an ME bin generated?</H1>

These are scripts for generating the matching concepts and have the prefix: "gen_".
The only one you will need is gen_source.pl which is specified in the ME.config file
and has these options:

<P>
<DL>
<DT>-s &lt;source(s)&gt;
<DD>This is used to specify the SAB's for the source or sources that go into making up
	this bin.  Remember that some sources may have multiple SABs (e.g., MedDRA).

<DT>-t &lt;termgroup(s)&gt;
<DD>This is used to specify the specific termgroup(s) that go into making up
	this bin.  We've rarely used this.

<DT>-c &lt;code(s)&gt;
<DD>This is a list of SQL LIKE expressions for matching on the CODE attribute.
	You will never need to use this.
</DL>

Here are some examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Source is HCPCS (SAB's are HCPCS00, CDT2, HCDT2, HCPT00, MTHHH00):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

gen_source.pl -s HCPCS00,CDT2,HCDT2,HCPT00,MTHHH00

</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>Source is MeSH (SAB is MSH2001):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

gen_source.pl -s MSH2001

</PRE>
</FONT>
</UL>

Please feel free to nag Apelon to update their source information page so you
can divine what the SAB's are for new sources.  As well the source description
information which needs to go into the configuration file.
The other generator scripts: gen-dem.pl, gen-norelease.pl, gen-leftovers.pl, etc. you will not
need to change.

<H1>HOW are ME bins ordered?</H1>
The ordering scripts are somewhat complicated.  In come cases, they also cluster
concepts and in the process may pick additional concepts to the cluster that are
not present in this bin in the ems_me_bins table.
<P>
I have implemented a common set of ordering scripts that has worked quite well
for the past few years.  These are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>order_treenum.pl</B>
<DD>This script uses a so-called "treenum" format that Steph and I agreed on:
	source_atom_id, sort field.  If all else fails you can always ask Apelon
	to make you a treenum's file for a given source and use this ordering
	script.  See <A HREF="/ems/doc/me_bins.html">here</A> for the details.

<P>
<DT><B>order_code.pl</B>
<DD>Use this if you want to order by code in a particular source.  The -n option will
do a numeric sort on the code.

<P>
<DT><B>order_alpha.pl</B>
<DD>This is useful if you want a simple alphabetic ordering.  It orders by the atom_name
from a source.
<P>
<DT><B>order_mesh.pl</B>
<DD>Orders MeSH atoms by tree number.
</DL>

These have sufficed for our needs so far.  There is one for demotions (order_dem.pl)
which you don't need to change.
<FONT COLOR=red>If LTI does not provide a sorting hint in the source information page,
NAG or use order_alpha.pl in the interim</FONT>.

<UL>
<LI>Contains concepts that meet a particular QA criterion.

<LI>Most queries are now implemented as integrities (MEME_INTEGRITY_PROC)
	Apelon is responsible for these.

<P><LI>The query that generates the concepts is also responsible for clustering them - so there
	is no ordering script.
<P><LI>QA bins have NO HISTORY - need to be edited down to 0!
<P><LI>chem/nonchem split is possible
<P><LI>Bins can be regenerated (generating query is rerun) and counts refreshed as with ME
<P><LI>Clusters are excluded from going out on worklists if a concept in it is:
	<P><OL>
	 <LI>an embryo,

<H1>How Ad-Hoc bins work</H1>

See <A HREF="/ems/doc/ah_bins.html">EMS documentation</A> for full information.
    
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Concepts are generated (and clustered) into ems_ah_bins
<P><LI>There is history (local, global and none)
	<P><UL>
	    <LI>global is across all epochs, default
	    <LI>local is within current epoch only
	    <LI>use N (never) cautiously
	    </UL>

<P><LI>There is a canonical bin name and an actual bin name
<P><LI>History is by canonical name, e.g.,
		- needsrel, needrel, needsrels, etc -> needsrel
<P><LI>Ordering script - currently unused - default is ordering by cluster_id.

<H1>DIFFERENT PATHWAY TO MAKE A CHECKLIST</H1>

<UL>
<P><LI>If you have a list of concepts or can get to a list of concepts,
	  possibly clustered, you can make it a checklist.

	<P><UL>
	<LI>Example: Concepts with strings that have the word "dog"

	    <FONT SIZE=-1>
	    <PRE>
SELECT distinct concept_id FROM normwrd n, classes c
WHERE  n.normwrd_id=c.atom_id
AND    n.normwrd = 'dog'
</PRE>
</FONT>

	<P><LI>Example: Concepts with releasable MedDRA atoms:

	    <FONT SIZE=-1>
	    <PRE>
SELECT distinct concept_id FROM classes WHERE tobereleased in ('y', 'Y')
AND    source like 'MDR%'
</PRE>
</FONT>

	<P><LI>Example: Concepts approved in the last 10 minutes

	    <FONT SIZE=-1>
	    <PRE>
SELECT distinct concept_id FROM concept_status

<UL>
<P><LI>Now simplified - uses JavaScript
<P><LI>Editors set some information about worklist, NLM sets the rest
<P><LI>Queries for matching worklists and tracking
<P><LI>Show report Queue, stamping
<P><LI>Documentation on how to make worklists, print, etc.
<P><LI>Can turn off editing, EMS/WMS via Web
</UL>

<P><HR><P>
<H1>Matrix Initialization</H1>

The matrix initializer computes
<A HREF="/cgi-oracle-meowusers/ems.pl?action=table_help&subaction=describe&table=concept_status&owner=MTH">concept_status</A>.status
for every concept in the Metathesaurus.  This can be run in "full" mode or in "catchup" mode.
Apelon runs it in the "full" mode after an insertion, etc.
In the catchup mode, only those concepts that have been recently affected will have
their status recomputed.
<P>
It is crucial that this process run unhindered as many of the ME bin data relies on
the concept status being current.  The EMS provides access to the matrix init log.

<P><HR><P>
<H1>General</H1>

<UL>
<P><LI>If backups are enabled on the database machine, the following takes
	place after backup: matrix initialization, ME repartitioning,
	(sometimes) batch QA regeneration and AH regeneration.
	These are in the script: /etc/AutoDump/make_ready_for_nlm.s
	on "oa.nlm.nih.gov".  Check with Joe if you want these on/off.
