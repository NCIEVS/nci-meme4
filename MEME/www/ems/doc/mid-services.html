<H1>MID Services - What is it?  Where is it?</H1>

This is a service that was initially provided to map symbolic
names to database names so that we could easily force our
tools (which use the symbolic names) to point to one of the
many databases that we use.  It has since been expanded for
other "services", e.g., the service for remote software distribution
on PCs.

<P>

The service runs on the hostname midns.nlm.nih.gov (midns=MID name service)
which is mapped to smis.nlm.nih.gov on TCP port 5125.
The server for this service is in /site/umls/scripts/midsvcs-server.pl
(see the /etc/inet/inetd.conf file for midsvcs).
The server reads the /etc/umls/mid-services file for the service
name and its current setting.

<P>

The client is in /site/umls/scripts/midsvcs.pl and, if run without
any arguments, list all the services currently supported along with
their current setting.  Any TCP client can be used, e.g., telnet.

<H1>/etc/umls/mid-services</H1>

This file contains two fields: the service name and its value.
The fields are '|' separated and empty lines and comments (lines with
a leading #) are encouraged.
The master copy of this file is on oa:/d5/MEME3/etc/mid-sevices and
is rdist'ed from there to all servers using the rdist script:
oa:/d5/MEME3/rdist/mid-services-dist.  Edit the data to suit,
and use the following to distribute to smis (as root):

<PRE>

  rdist -f /d5/MEME3/rdist/mid-services-dist

</PRE>
</FONT>

The change should take effect immediately (you may need to force your
web browser to reload).  You can view the current settings here:
<A HREF="/db.shtml">http://meow/db.shtml</A>.

<H1>Why do we need this?</H1>

We usually have a production database, a backup (or browse) database and several
databases for testing software and source insertions.  The names for these
databases (and the machines they are on) may change, but the symbolic name remains
the same.  For example, <EM>current-editing-tns</EM> always refers to the production
database.

<P>

Our tools use these symbolic names for accessing the data.  We can
be quickly back in action after a disk failure, say, by pointing
the service current-editing-tns to the backup database while the production
database is being repaired.  Similarly, we can test source insertions, etc
on different databases without hardwiring these names in all our scripts.
<P>
The distributed nature of this (it is implemented using the TCP/IP protocol)
also means that remote clients query for the service name before accessing the
database.
<P>
Here are some mappings and their meaning:

<DL>
<DT>current-editing-tns|oa_mid2001
<DD>The current MEME-3 production database.
<DT>current-partitioning-tns|oa_mid2001
<DD>The database to partition by the script batch_partition.pl which is called
	every morning after backup in the /etc/AutoDump/make_ready_for_nlm.s script.
<DT>current-browse-tns|oa_mid2001
<DD>The database that can be used for browsing (concept reports, etc) while the
production database is used.  This is the default for concept reports on meow
and usually points to the production database, except during insertions.
<DT>current-unedited-tns|oc_unedited
<DD>This is a beginning-of-the-year copy of the database before any editing has taken place.
Useful for checking the last released version.
<DT>current-testsrc-tns|oc_testsrc
<DD>Database for testing source insertions.
<DT>current-testsw-tns|oc_mid2001
<DD>Database for testing software.
<DT>current-training-tns|oc_training
<DD>A training database for training editors.
