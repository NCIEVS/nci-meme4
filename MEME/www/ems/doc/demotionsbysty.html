<h1>
Extracting Demotions by STY</h1>

The script to extract clusters of concepts that have
one or more STYs is ready.  You can feed the output
directly to make-checklist.pl to make these into
checklists for editing.

<P>

The script lives in:
<PRE>

/site/umls/scripts/demotions_by_sty.pl

</PRE>

It takes these options:

<P>
<DL>
<DT>-d (database)
<DD>Specifies an alternate database (default is editing-db)
<DT>-c
<DD>Displays the current list of STYs and cluster counts for
concepts participating in demotions.  The output contains
the STY, the UI for the STY, whether chemical or non-chemical,
and the demotion cluster count.
<DT>-n
<DD>same as -c but numerical, reverse sort by frequency
<DT>-s (list of STYs)
<DD>A list of semantic types to restrict the output.
The STYs are comma separated and can be spelled out,
e.g., "Disease or Syndrome,Medical Device" or specied
as the UI, e.g., "T019,T032", or even just the
numbers, e.g., 19,23.
<P>
In this form, the query can be used as a generator for
QA and AH bins.
</DL>

<P>
Here are some examples:
<P>
Show the cluster count by STY (ordered by STY):
<PRE>


/site/umls/scripts/demotions_by_sty.pl -c

</PRE>

<P>
Demotions where a concept has the STY "Medical Device"
and make it a checklist called "chk_meddem":
<PRE>

/site/umls/scripts/demotions_by_sty.pl -s 74 |
  /site/umls/scripts/make-checklist.pl -c chk_meddem

</PRE>

<P>
Demotions with any of these STYs: Congenital Abnormality
or Acquired Abnormality:
<PRE>

/site/umls/scripts/demotions_by_sty.pl -s 19,20

</PRE>

<P>
You can make QA bins using this command by editing the QA.config
file.  You must use the -s option to specify one or more STYs
if you do this.  For example this will create a bin
of demoted clusters for the STY "Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component"
(T023).
