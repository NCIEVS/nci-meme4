<H1>How to Change the Epoch</H1>

(What is an <A HREF="/ems/doc/faq.html#2">epoch</A>?)

<P>

<UL>

<P><LI>
The epoch can now be changed in the EMS.

<P><LI>
Decide what the epoch is going to be called, e.g., 01a, etc.
Names are conventionally 3 characters - the first two are the
two-digit release year (last two chars of the MID name) followed
by a lowercase alpha character, a, b, etc.  Thus for the MID
with the TNS name <B>oa_mid2002</B> say, the first epoch will be <B>02a</B> and
the next <B>02b</B>, etc.

<P><LI>
Ensure that the new epoch sorts after the previous one in ASCII order, e.g., 02b comes after 02a.

<P><LI>
Optional: set older epochs (say 98b) to inactive by using sqlplus (as meow):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

UPDATE ems_current_editing_epoch SET active='N' WHERE epoch='98b';

</PRE>
</FONT>

This controls which epochs show up in the WMS query menu.
<P>
You can also remove old worklist tables (for the epochs you have
deemed inactive) from the database.  These worklists are tables in the
database whose names have the prefix <EM>wrk&lt;epoch&gt;_</EM>.
<P>
But first ensure that these have been stamped/returned in
the WMS and always check with Tammy/Laura.  I usually
keep a whole year's worth in the DB.  Remember, worklists are
also archived in UNIX and we have tapes.  So nothing is
ever irretrievably lost.  I usually end up scripting
this if there are more than a handful.
