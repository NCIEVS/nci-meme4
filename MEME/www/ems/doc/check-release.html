<H1>Checking Release</H1>

There are many levels of checks one can do on the release files.
These are mostly low level checks.  Larger content issues should be
checked prior to making the CDs, e.g., did new source X terms get the
right STY?  Or, did non-releaseable source Y make it to the release?

<P>

At this point you have run the run the master2dist.pl script which
made the ZIP and TAR files and populated the wthsun:/d21/2001 (or your
current release) directories.
<P>

<OL>

<P><LI> Check to see if the compressed contents are identical to the
uncompressed versions.  See <A HREF="compare-meta.html">compare-meta.pl</A>.

<P><LI>
Now the following tests can be done on another machine, say smis.
Transfer the newly made TAR to smis and de-compress.

<P><LI>
There following are some simple syntax checks on the MR files in META.  Coordinate with
Bill (wth@nlm) who runs other QA (fmtqa and ccnt - these look for 8-bit characters
etc.)

<P><LI>
The sort-check.pl script ensures that all MR files are in ASCII sort order and
that there aren't any duplicate rows.
Use /site/umls/release/sort-check.pl as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/sort-check.pl -m /d21/2001/UNIX/UMLS2001

</PRE>
</FONT>

The output should not contain the string ERROR (MRRANK is known to not
be in sort order).  The -m option is a minimal
path to the MR files - the script uses <EM>find</EM> from there to look.

<P><LI>
The field-check.pl script checks that all rows in each MR file have
the right number of fields as specified in MRFILES.
Use /site/umls/release/field-check.pl as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/field-check.pl -m /d3/Release/UMLS2001

</PRE>
</FONT>

The output should not contain the string ERROR
The -m option is a minimal
path to the MR files - the script uses <EM>find</EM> from there to look.

<P><LI>
The cuiqa.pl script checks to see if MR files that have CUIs have
legitimate ones.  It assumes that MRSO is the authority on CUIs and
checks other the files to see if their CUIs are in this list.
This script is configured with two lists: one that tells it
which files (and which fields in them) have ALL CUIs and the
second which tells it which files have CUIs but not necessarily all of them.
Here is the current list (fields start at #0):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

# Files (and field numbers) that *should* have all CUIs
@filesWithAllCUIS = (
		     [ "MRCON", 0 ],
		     [ "MRSO", 0 ],
		     [ "MRSTY", 0 ],
		     [ "MRXW.ENG", 2 ],
		     [ "MRXNS.ENG", 2 ],
		     [ "MRXNW.ENG", 2 ],
		     );

# These don't necessarily have all CUIs
@otherFiles = (
		     [ "MRREL", [0, 2] ],
		     [ "MRATX", 0 ],
		     [ "MRCOC", [0, 1] ],
		     [ "MRCXT", 0 ],
		     [ "MRDEF", 0 ],
		     [ "MRLO", 0 ],
		     [ "MRSAT", 0 ]
		     );

Note that the indexes may not have *all* CUIs - a handful of strings norm to nothing
for example.  So examing the output *after* your first cup of coffee.
Run /site/umls/release/cuiqa.pl as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/cuiqa.pl -d /d21/2001/UNIX/UMLS2001

</PRE>
</FONT>

Of course, the results are only as good as the CUIs in MRSO.
As mentioned, expect some errors for the index files
(MRX*) since some CUIs won't have rows if the string has no tokens
(or norm forms), e.g., the concept '*'.

<P><LI>
This is our *monster* syntax check on all fields.  The script is
called format-qa.pl.
For example, all CUIs should match the regular expression: /^C[0-9]{7}$/
and TS's should match /^[TSs]$/.
The script /site/umls/release/format-qa.pl checks for this.  It
uses MRFILES and MRCOLS to figure out column positions, names, etc.
and has a built in list of formats to check.  Run as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/format-qa.pl -m /d21/2001/UNIX/UMLS2001

</PRE>
</FONT>

You can use the -x option for status messages to STDERR
every n'th record (default is 1000 can be changed by the -n option)
for every file processed.  This is gently reassuring to see that
the script is actually doing something!
<P>
This is an overnight run.  Examine the output for errors.
<P>
Here is the current list of regular expression checks for
different fields as coded in the script.  You can add more
(using these as a template) by editing the script.
Remember that some fields can be null, e.g., CUI2.
The looser the constraint the more you'll have to wade through
the output.

Check the data in MRFILES regarding number of fields, rows and bytes of each MR file
using this script:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/check-mrfiles.pl -m /d21/2001/UNIX/UMLS2001/META

<P><LI>
Now you can use 'meow' to to higher level semantic checks on the content.
Follow the instructions <A HREF="after-release.html">here</A>.

<P><LI>Congratulations, you pass!!
