<H1>Naming Releases</H1>

This document specifies the convention for the naming of UMLS releases.
Note that the convention was adopted in 2001 so previous releases will
not follow these rules though the rules themselves are backward compatible.

<P>

A release name follows the format: YYYYVV_SS where:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>YYYY is a 4 digit year, e.g., 2001
<LI>VV is a two letter designation for the version ID starting with "AA", e.g., 2001AA
<LI>SS is a two digit subset ID where needed (e.g., "02")
</UL>
<P>
The first release of the year (called a January release) will have the
version ID of "AA".  Subsequent releases for that year will have a version ID
of "AB", "AC", etc.

<P>
Releases that are created as subsets using MetamorphoSys will have
a subset ID designation starting with 01 and counting up.
<P>
A release that is not a subset is termed a "Base" release.
<P>
Examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>2001AA -> January release for 2001
<LI>2002AC_02 -> second subset of the third release (AC) in 2002
<LI>2020GD_78 (hope we don't get to this!)
</UL>

<H1>Disc Names</H1>

There is no longer room for the UM or UMLS in the disc and file names.
So the discs names will the the release name followed by "_ZIP" or "_TAR".
Example,

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

  2001AB_ZIP
  2001AB_TAR
  2001AC_02_TAR
  
</PRE>
</FONT>

(Note: these names will work even when they include the subset number, 
e.g. 2001AC_02_TAR")
<P>
and the ZIP and TGZ files have the name of the release with the ZIP or TGZ
extention, for example:
 
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

   2001AB.ZIP
   2001AC_02.TGZ
  
</PRE>
</FONT>

With the subset number these file names will be Joliet compliant
but not ISO9660 compliant,  We have decided to allow this.

<P>

The top directory names on the CD will be identical to the release names, e.g.,
2002AA or 2001AC_02.

<P>   

We'll use the same pattern for all future releases.

<H1>Multiple CDs</H1>

When we need more than one disc, let's do the following for the disc names; it fits the Joliet
standard:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

     YYYYVV_SS_ZIP-#
e.g. 2001AB_01_TAR-1:

  VV =  within year version
  _SS = subset number where needed
  -# = disk # (will work to -99, note hyphen)

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P>

The manual will need to explain that ALL discs must be extracted
to have the full release.
