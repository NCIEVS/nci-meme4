<H1>Missed Synonymy</H1>

The missed synonmymy suite has been rewritten as a client-server application
and modified to support client and server-side parallelism.
As we look for more word or phrase level synonymy that
drives this processes, speed will be a critical issue.
We are, for example, evaluating Wordnet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/)
as a source of additional synonymy.
<P>
Other areas of progress include:
<UL>
<P><LI>The programs do not need a database refresh anymore.  Relevant
data from the current database are loaded into one or more databases
before the process begins.  <P><LI>The program runs in TCP
client-server mode (default port 17000).  The server serves up pairs
of words or phrases along with the name of a database search in.  The
clients take this information and run newphrasesub.pl against the database
suggested by the server to look for missed synonymy.

<P>

<H1>How to run</H1>

<UL>

<P><LI> The missed synonymy "home" is in ob.nlm.nih.gov:/d3/rpts/missyn.

<P><LI> Identify machines and databases that can be spared for up to a week without
affecting editing.  As noted, these databases do not need to be refreshed, just be available
for this work.  Also identify the machine that will run the server process.  <EM>ob</EM> should
be a good choice for this as the load falls most heavily on this machine.

<P><LI>
Note that it is not necessary to disable backups on machines running the databases from the
above step. The server can be conservatively run during the day say between 8am and 8pm
via cron (see below).

<P><LI>The server will log to the files: progress.log, result.log and concepts.log, synfile.log
in /d3/rpts/missyn.  So back up the old versions of these files (first three, anyway) if needed.
Then remove them to start from a clean state.  The synfile.log file tracks which file was
last being processed and at what offset.

<P><LI> Create the normstr_lvg184h and normwrd_lvg184h tables in the databases you wish
to use.  The script /site/umls/missyn/make-missyn-tables.pl will make them for you.
It is a good idea to create the tables in as many databases as you can afford to
(these are created in parallel).  This gives you the flexibility to use them or not
later when running the synonymy finder.
<P>
Run as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/missyn/make-missyn-tables.pl -d &lt;database to load from&gt;
                                  -o &lt;databases to load to&gt;
                                  -t &lt;tmpdir&gt;

For example,

/site/umls/missyn/make-missyn-tables.pl -d oa_mid2002 -o ob_mid2002,oc_testsrc,oc_testsw,oa_mid2002 -t /tmp

</PRE>
</FONT>

will load current data from oa_mid2002 into the specified databases.

<P><LI>After the tables have been loaded (should take a few hours), you can configure
the missed synonymy server.  This uses a config file (/d3/rpts/missyn/missyn.config) to direct
requests to the different databases with uniform probability.  The config file
consists of lines of the form:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
database|percentage
</PRE>
</FONT>

For example:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
oa_mid2002|10
oc_testsrc|40
ob_mid2002|
</PRE>
</FONT>

If the percentage is left unspecified, the remainder of the queries are sent to it.
Ideally the percentages should add to 100%.  Here oa_mid2002 will get 10% of the requests,
oc_testsrc 40% and ob_mid2002 50%.  You can change the data on the fly (for better load
balancing); the data is re-read at each iteration.

<P><LI>
Decide how long you want to run the server.  The server takes the -t {\d+}{hms} option
to tell it how long to run.  Or the -n option to tell it how many iterations.
If backups cannot be turned off, you can run the server
everyday between 8am and 8pm via cron.  The cron should have:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

0 8 * * * /site/umls/missyn/missyn-server.pl -c /d3/rpts/missyn/missyn.config
				    -w /net/smis/aux/d3/ems/worklists
				    -t 12h

</PRE>
</FONT>

Make sure to turn off the cron when you are done!

<LI> Run the server as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/missyn/missyn-server.pl -c &lt;config file&gt;
                                   -t &lt;time to run&gt;
                                   -n &lt;iterations to run&gt;
                                   -w &lt;path to worklist directory for history&gt;
                                   -p &lt;TCP port - default is 17000&gt;

</PRE>
</FONT>

The path to the directory containing the worklists (ZIP files) is usually
/net/smis/aux/d3/ems/worklists and this should work from all machines.

<P><LI>
The client program in /site/umls/missyn/missyn-client.pl simply queries the server
for the next phrase pair and a database and runs the newphrasesub.pl program against
that database.  The results are sent back to the server.  The client exits
if the server is either unavailable, returns an empty string or there is a control
file (see below).  The client options are:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/missyn/missyn-client.pl -t &lt;time to run&gt;
                                   -n &lt;iterations to run&gt;
                                   -h &lt;server host&gt; (default is ob)
                                   -p &lt;server TCP port - default is 17000&gt;
                                   -w &lt;number of forked copies of the client&gt; (default is 1)

</PRE>
</FONT>

As you see, you can tell the client to replicate itself with the -w option to speed the
process along.  Or you can run the client for an hour on your machine while you are
at lunch.  All spare CPUs can be brought to bear on the problem.  Of course, as with
all good things in life, there is a limit - or the server's TCP queue will be swamped.
I find that about 15-20 client going full blast is the upper end.

</UL>

<H1>Control files</H1>

How can you stop the client or the server midway through the processing?
The server exits immediately (when there is a connection from a client) if it detects
the file: /tmp/missyn.server.trigger while the clients exit if they find the
file: /tmp/missyn.client.trigger on the local machine.

<DL>
<P><DT> /tmp/missyn.server.trigger
<DD> Presence of this file causes the server program to immediately stop processing
additional word pairs.  Additional client requests will fail and cause the client to
exit as well.

<P><DT> /tmp/missyn.client.trigger
<DD> The client (all subprocesses) will quit before the next iteration if it detects this file.

<P><DT> /tmp/missyn.lock
<DD> On the server, this file prevents multiple copies of the server from running.  You shouldn't
have to deal with this file except to remove it if the server exists abnormally for some reason
(shouldn't!).

<P><DT> The database
<DD>The server will also exit if the database it is in the process of returning to a client
is not available.  This guards against the possiblity that the database can crash.
</DL>

<H1>Log files</H1>

Data is logged in 3 files in /d3/rpts/missyn:

<DL>
<P><DT> concepts.log
<DD> Contains the concept_id pairs for feeding to the EMS.  Columns are:
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

concept_id_1|concept_id_2|edited?|phrase 1|norm phrase 1|phrase 2|norm phrase 2|DB|phrase #|Algorithm|date

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><DT> result.log
<DD> Contains meta information about the search results.  This is used by the server to
determine which phrases have already been processed.  Columns are:
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

phrase 1|norm phrase 1|phrase 2|norm phrase 2|DB|phrase #|Client IP|client name|client ID|time secs|number matched|Algo|Date

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><DT> progress.log
<DD> Logs helpful self-explanatory messages from the program.  A tail -f of this file
should give you some idea of the progress being made.  Columns are:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

Msg|Phrase1|Normphrase1|Phrase2|Normphrase2|DB|Phrase #|Client IP|Client Name|Client ID|time secs|number matched|algo|Date

</PRE>
</FONT>

</DL>

<H1>On completion</H1>
If the tail of the progress log file shows the line: ALL SYNONYM FILES DONE,
then you are done.

<P>
Copy the concepts.log file over to smis:/d3/rpts/missyn/ into a file called
concepts.log.MM.DD.YYYY.

<P>
Change the link on smis:/d3/rpts/missyn/concepts.current to point to
this new file.  The AH bin generator script: /site/umls/missyn/missyn-cat.pl
which simply cat's the content of this file will pick up the new info
on the next regenerate.
