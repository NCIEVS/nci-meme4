<H1>How to package the release files</H1>

<FONT COLOR=red>See <A HREF="packaging-release-new.html">here</A> for an updated version
of this documentation (a work in progress)!</A>
</FONT>
<P>

This documents the process of creating the ZIP and TGZ files for a
given release.  These files can be put on CD and/or made available on
the KSS for download.
<P>
NLM currently makes 4 releases a year with the names &lt;YYYY&gt;AA,
&lt;YYYY&gt;AB, &lt;YYYY&gt;AC, &lt;YYYY&gt;AD, where &lt;YYYY&gt;
is a 4 digit year designation. e.g., 2002AA.  These are termed as
"base" releases.  There can be revisions to a base release (upto 99)
when one or more files need correction.  These revisions can be made
into a "change" release containing only the changed files or a full
release containing all the material from the base release
with all the accumulated changes.  A revised release cannot contain
any more or fewer files, just different versions of existing files.

<P>

For example, after making the 2002AB base release, we find an error in
MRCXT.  We produce a fixed version of MRCXT and make a release
(revisionID=01) with the corrected MRCXT in the correct directory
structure so it can be downloaded and unpacked. We also make a full
and correct 2002AB with the correct MRCXT.  These are then put on the
KSS for download.

<P>

The following schematic illustrates the notion of base and revised
releases.  Note that a January release (version ID="AA") is a base
release (the first one of the year), and usually the only one sent to
the UMLS licensees at large.

<UL>
<LI>The script is in /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl.
<LI>$VERSION is the current version, e.g., 2002AA. Refer <A HREF="release-naming.html">to this document</A>
to understand release naming conventions.  $JANVERSION is the name of the January
release for that year, e.g., for VERSION=2002AC, JANVERSION is 2002AA.
<LI>$TOP refers to the top-level directory where the release is made.
Historically this has been wthsun:/d21/$VERSION, but this may
change in the future.
<LI>$MASTER refers to the release's master directory where the masters of files are stored.
For a base release this is $TOP/MASTER but for a revision release this is $TOP/MASTER_##.

<HR>

<H1>Steps to make a base release</H1>

<OL>

<P><LI>Create the $TOP directory (e.g., wthsun:/d21/2002AA) with the
MASTER subdirectory.  The script will create the UNIX, ISO, ZIP and
TAR subdirectories.  Under MASTER create the $VERSION subdirectory
beneath which go the standard directories (META, NET, LEX, etc.)  The
$VERSION subdirectory will be the top level of the directory structure
in the compressed files.

<P><LI>Populate $MASTER with the correct versions of the files.
Text files should be UNIX line terminated.  Please take care to ensure that
the format and content of the files are <em>exactly</em> as expected.
When complete, the resulting directory structure should be something similar
to this:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER/
    $VERSION/
        META/
        METASUBSET/
        DOC/
        LEX/
        NET/

</PRE>
</FONT>

IMPORTANT: Remember to use FTP to transfer large files, not rcp, as
you move files over from producer.  For the truly paranoid, follow
that up with a MD5 digest on both machines (source and target) and
verify that the copy was successful.  You can do this with
/site/bin/md5.  We once had a problem with a malfunctioning disk array
corrupting some bytes in the file.  So byte counts may not always be
foolproof.

<P><LI>The following files
are expected to be in the MASTER directory
(this is new for 2002AB).  README.txt, Copyright_Notice.txt,
release.dat, README_MMS.txt and
MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip.  Ensure that these files are correct and
current.  So we have:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER/
    README.txt
    Copyright_Notice.txt
    release.dat
    README.MMS
    MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip

    $VERSION/
        META/
        ...

</PRE>
</FONT>

The MetamorphoSys system will be unpacked in the META/METAMSYS
directory.  The non-MetamorphoSys files will be copied to the top
directory of the image and the DOC subdirectory.  The README.MMS
additionally gets copied to the META/METAMSYS directory.  Note that
the top level directory in the MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip file should
be METAMSYS.  The script checks for this as well as the integrity of
the zip file.

<P><LI>Since 2001AC, there is a file called <CODE>release.dat</CODE>
that goes in the $TOP/$VERSION/MASTER/$VERSION directory.  This is
used by MetamorphoSys and maybe other programs.  Please ensure that
the file is there and that its contents are correct.  If not,
contact Apelon.

<P><LI>Get the current LVG release from Guy/Allen and unpack in the
LEX subdirectory.

<P><LI>Get the current Semantic Network files from Alexa/Olivier and
unpack in the NET subdirectory.

<P><LI>The METASUBSET directory should be present but empty.

<P><LI>Get the latest documentation from Bill/Laura and install in the
DOC directory.  Bill's script collates the documentation files
maintained by Laura into single text and HTML files.  Here's <A
HREF="masterdoc.txt">a pointer</A> to instructions from Bill on this
topic.  Note that the README file is now called README.txt and the
CPYRIGHT files is now Copyright_Notice.txt (see <A
HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov/hypermail/nlmreg-folders/nlmreg_0204/0390.html">this
thread on nlmreg</A>).

<P><LI>Remove all extraneous files in MASTER.  The script looks for some
standard ones (emacs backup and checkpoint files, for example), but this
cannot really be automated.

<P><LI>Login as 'wth' or 'suresh' on 'wthsun', cd to $TOP/MASTER and run as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

cd /d21/2002AA
/site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d /d21/2002AA -v 2002AA -t 200101010701.01 >& ! master2dist.log

</PRE>
</FONT>

Note the timestamp, by convention, is set to 7:01 of January 1 for the January release.
For other base releases, set as needed - currently Spring: Apr 1, Summer: Jul 1, Fall:
Oct 1.

<P><LI>IMPORTANT!  Look at the saved log file master2dist.log for
errors (grep -i error).  If you're satisfied that there are no errors,
congratulations, it's a release!

<P><LI>The TAR and ZIP directories will contain the TGZ and ZIP files
respectively that will be mastered on the CD as well as made available
for download on the KSS.  If the resulting files are too large to fit
on a CD (~650Mbytes), re-run the script first with a -g option for
better compression and, failing that, with the -Z or -T options to
break up the compressed files.  There will also files in the TAR
and ZIP directory containing the MD5's and checksum's for all the files.

</OL>

<H1>Revisions to a Release</H1>

A release can be revised by modifying one or more files.  This is
first assigned a revision ID (between 01 and 99), and then the changes
are stored in $TOP/MASTER_## where ## is the revision ID.
The version of the file should be current and must contain all intervening
changes for this file since the base release.  In other words, users
should be able to be current by installing the version in the latest
MASTER_## directory.  The script will ensure that all independent
invervening changes will be made, i.e., changes to other files.

<P>
The script is run with the -M option which then produces two sets of
TAR and ZIP directories: TAR_##_CHG, TAR_##_FULL and ZIP_##_CHG and
ZIP_##_FULL.  The *CHG directories contain just the changes (and
accompanying documentation) while the *FULL contain the full release
with the modifications.

<P>
Here are the steps involved:

<OL>

<P><LI>Leave the original MASTER and its derivatives (UNIX, ISO, TAR
and ZIP) unchanged!

<P><LI>Create the MASTER_## directory under $TOP, where ## is a two
digit revision ID, e.g., MASTER_01, MASTER_03, etc.

<P><LI>Change is cumulative.  All prior changes will be rolled into
the new version by the script.  For example, if you are currently
creating files for revision 03, the changes from MASTER_01 and
MASTER_02 will be copied into the UNIX_03 directory automatically
<EM>in order</EM>, i.e., MASTER_01 before MASTER_02.  The MASTER_03
directory will be as you populated it and is not otherwise modified.
Only the derivative directories: UNIX_03*, ISO_03*, TAR_03* and
ZIP_03* will contain the prior revisions.

<P><LI>Create just the structure under it to populate the change files
in their proper places.  For example, if MRCXT has changed, create:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER_03
    $VERSION/
        META/
            MRCXT

</PRE>
</FONT>

You do not need to create the full directory structure, though you do
have to have the correct structure for the files you are changing.

<P><LI>In the MASTER_## directory, copy and update (if needed) the
README.txt and the Copyright_Notice.txt files.  You will also need a
addendum file to explain what changed in this revision.  This file is
called: Addendum_##.txt, where ## is the revision ID.  The addendum is
cumulative and must contain descriptions for all the changes since the
base release.

<P><LI>If you are updating Metamorphosys, you will also need the
README.MMS and the MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip files in MASTER_##.  If
you are not updating MetamorphoSys, skip this step.  If you are
<EM>only</EM> updating MetamorphoSys in this revision, you only need
the new MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip file and the README.MMS files.  The
README.txt and Copyright_Notice.txt files are always needed.  Be aware
that the presence or absence of the MetamorphoSys files is the trigger
for whether or not you want to update MetamorphoSys.  If these files
are not present, the latest versions (found by scanning prior
revisions or the MASTER) is used for the "full" revised release.

<P><LI>For example to update just MRCXT:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER_03

    README.txt
    Copyright_Notice.txt
    Addendum_03.txt

    $VERSION/
        release.dat

        META/
            MRCXT

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>Ensure that the release.txt in MASTER_##/$VERSION/release.dat
is correct.  It must have the same revision ID and a timestamp. See
(<A HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov/hypermail/nlmreg-folders/nlmreg_0104/0132.html">nlmreg</A>)
for the discussion.

<P><LI>Create a file called "md5" in MASTER_## that has the MD5 checksum of all the
change files.  This can be created with (after ensuring that the right version of
the right files are in place!):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

cd $TOP/MASTER_##
/site/bin/md5 `/bin/find $VERSION -type f -print` > md5

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>cd to $TOP/MASTER_## run the script with the -M option as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d /d21/2002AA -v 2002AA -t 200103010701 -M MASTER_03 >& ! master2dist_03.log

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>This should create the following directories in $TOP:
ZIP_03_CHG, ZIP_03_FULL, TAR_03_CHG and TAR_03_FULL among others.
These will contain the files: 2002AA_C03.ZIP, 2002AA_F03.ZIP,
2002AA_C03.TGZ and 2002AA_F03.TGZ resp.  The "C" in the file name
refers to the change-only release while the "F" is a full release with
the changes.  The two digits following is the revision ID.  If the -Z
and -T options are further specified, multiple ZIP's and TAR's are
created for the "full" release (e.g., 2002AA_1_F03.ZIP and
2002AA_2_F03.ZIP).  The changes will always be in a single file.

<P><LI>The change files is put up on the KSS with appropriate instructions
on how to download and unpack, while the full file can overwrite the
original release file, so new downloads pick up the changes.

<P><LI>All post-release steps must be taken with the new "full"
version (e.g., test MetamorphoSys, load MySQL database, generate URIS
information, etc).
</OL>

<H1>Files in the $MASTER Directory</H1>

This section describes files that need to be present in the $MASTER
directory before a release can be made.
<P>
The text files may all optionally have an HTML and a PDF version in the future.
All the text files are copied by script to: the release's top directory (in the
ZIP and TAR), the release's DOC directory (in the ZIP and TAR) and also to the
directory containing the ZIP and TAR that will be mastered on CD.
