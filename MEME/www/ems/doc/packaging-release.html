<H1>How to package the release files</H1>

This documents the process of creating the compressed files for a release.
These files can be put on CD(s) and/or made available on the KSS for download.
<P>
NLM currently makes 4 releases a year with the names &lt;YYYY&gt;AA,
&lt;YYYY&gt;AB, &lt;YYYY&gt;AC, &lt;YYYY&gt;AD, where &lt;YYYY&gt;
is a 4 digit year designation. e.g., 2002AA.  These are termed as
"base" releases.  There can be revisions to a base release (upto 99)
when one or more files need correction.  These revisions can be made
into a "change" release containing only the changed files or a full
release containing all the material from the base release
with all the accumulated changes.  A revised release cannot contain
any more or fewer files, just different versions of existing files.

<P>

For example, after making the 2002AB base release, we find an error in
MRCXT.  We produce a fixed version of MRCXT and make a release
(revisionID=01) with the corrected MRCXT in the correct directory
structure so it can be downloaded and unpacked. We also make a full
and correct 2002AB with the correct MRCXT.  These are then put on the
KSS for download.

<P>

The following schematic illustrates the notion of base and revised
releases.  Note that a January release (version ID="AA") is a base
release (the first one of the year), and usually the only one sent to
the UMLS licensees at large.

<H1>Notes for discussion below</H1>
<UL>
<LI>The script is in /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl.
<LI>$VERSION is the current version, e.g., 2002AA. Refer <A HREF="release-naming.html">to this document</A>
to understand release naming conventions.  $JANVERSION is the name of the January
release for that year, e.g., for VERSION=2002AC, JANVERSION is 2002AA.
<LI>$TOP refers to the top-level directory where the release is made.
Historically this has been wthsun:/d21/$VERSION, but this may
change in the future.
<LI>$MASTER refers to the release's master directory where the masters of files are stored.
For a base release this is $TOP/MASTER but for a revision release this is $TOP/MASTER_##.

<H1>Script Options</H1>
The script: /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl has the following options:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR><TD>-d</TD><TD>Absolute path to $TOP, e.g., /d21/2002AA</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-v</TD><TD>Version being made, e.g., 2002AA</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-t</TD><TD>Timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMI.SS format with the .SS being
optional.  All files and directories in the resulting compressed files will have this
timestamp. See man page for the touch command.  E.g., 200201010701</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-g</TD><TD>Compression quality for the compression program (gzip or zip) (has to be an
integer between 1 (least and fastest) to 9 (best and slowest).  Default is 6.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-2</TD><TD>A comma separated list of MR files to be put on a second compressed file.
This is needed if the resulting ZIP exceeds 650 MBytes.  E.g., -2 MRCXT,MRSO</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-p</TD><TD>This flag will parallelize the UNIX2COMPRESS and ISO2COMPRESS processes.
<TR><TD>-f</TD><TD>This flag forces a run, otherwise only a report is produced.
<TR><TD>-z</TD><TD>This flag uses the "zip" program to make the UNIX compressed file.  Otherwise
gzip and tar are used to produce a "TGZ" file.
<TR><TD>-r</TD><TD>The option specifies a two digit revision ID, e.g., 01.  The script expects
to find a MASTER_&lt;ID&gt; directory containing only changes to an existing release.
<TR><TD>-s</TD><TD>Logs to STDERR as the script runs.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The script will create a "log" subdirectory in master and archive the output of the script,
the timestamps of the files in MASTER used to make the release.  Do not remove
this directory or change its contents.  The master2dist.log in MASTER is the log of the
latest run.

<HR>

<H1>Steps to make a base release</H1>

Releases are now made in umls-source:/umls/Releases.

<OL>

<P><LI>Create the $TOP directory (e.g., umls-source:/umls/Releases/2003AA).
Run the script /site/umls/release/make-release-dirs.pl with the -v option
to create the skeleton directory structure. E.g.,

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/make-release-dirs.pl -v 2004AA

</PRE>
</FONT>

This will create the MASTER directory where the master contents
of the UMLS knowledge sources are stored.
The master2dist.pl script will create the UNIX, ISO, UNIXCOMPRESS and
ISOCOMPRESS subdirectories. 

<P><LI>Populate $MASTER with the correct versions of the files.  Text
files should be UNIX line terminated.  Please take care to ensure that
the format and content of the files are <em>exactly</em> as expected.
When complete, the resulting directory structure should be something
similar to this:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER/
    $VERSION/
        META/
        METASUBSET/
        DOC/
        LEX/
        NET/

</PRE>
</FONT>

IMPORTANT: Remember to use FTP to transfer large files, not rcp, as
you move files over from producer.  For the truly paranoid, follow
that up with a MD5 digest on both machines (source and target) and
verify that the copy was successful.  You can do this with
/site/bin/md5.  We once had a problem with a malfunctioning disk array
corrupting some bytes in the file.  So byte counts may not always be
foolproof.

<P><LI>The following files
are expected to be in the MASTER directory
(this is new for 2002AB).  README.txt, Copyright_Notice.txt,
release.dat, README_MMS.txt and
MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip.  Ensure that these files are correct and
current.  So we have:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER/
    README.txt
    Copyright_Notice.txt
    release.dat
    README.MMS
    MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip

    $VERSION/
        META/
        ...

</PRE>
</FONT>

The MetamorphoSys system will be unpacked in the META/METAMSYS
directory.  The non-MetamorphoSys files will be copied to the top
directory of the image and the DOC subdirectory.  The README.MMS
additionally gets copied to the META/METAMSYS directory.  Note that
the top level directory in the MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip file should
be METAMSYS.  The script checks for this as well as the integrity of
the zip file.

<P><LI>Since 2001AC, there is a file called <CODE>release.dat</CODE>
that goes in the $TOP/$VERSION/MASTER/$VERSION directory.  This is
used by MetamorphoSys and maybe other programs.  Please ensure that
the file is there and that its contents are correct.  If not,
contact Apelon.

<P><LI>Get the current LVG release from Guy/Allen and unpack in the
LEX subdirectory.

<P><LI>Get the current Semantic Network files from Alexa/Olivier and
unpack in the NET subdirectory.

<P><LI>The METASUBSET directory should be present but empty.

<P><LI>Get the latest documentation from Bill/Laura and install in the
DOC directory.  Bill's script collates the documentation files
maintained by Laura into single text and HTML files.  Here's <A
HREF="masterdoc.txt">a pointer</A> to instructions from Bill on this
topic.  Note that the README file is now called README.txt and the
CPYRIGHT files is now Copyright_Notice.txt (see <A
HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov/hypermail/nlmreg-folders/nlmreg_0204/0390.html">this
thread on nlmreg</A>).

<P><LI>Remove all extraneous files in MASTER.  The script looks for some
standard ones (emacs backup and checkpoint files, for example), but this
cannot really be automated.

<P><LI>Login as 'wth' or 'suresh' on 'wthsun', cd to $TOP/MASTER and run as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

cd /d21/2002AA
/site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d /d21/2002AA -v 2002AA -t 200101010701.01 -f -p -s

</PRE>
</FONT>

Note the timestamp, by convention, is set to 7:01 of January 1 for the January release.
For other base releases, set as needed - currently Spring: Apr 1, Summer: Jul 1, Fall:
Oct 1.

<P><LI>IMPORTANT!  Look at the saved log file master2dist.log for
errors (grep -i error).  If you're satisfied that there are no errors,
congratulations, it's a release!

<P><LI>Each run is logged to $MASTERDIR/log along with the timestamps
of each file that went into making the compressed files.

<P><LI>The UNIXCOMPRESS and ISOCOMPRESS directories will contain the compressed
files (ZIP or TGZ) that will be mastered on the CD as well as made available
for download on the KSS.  If the resulting files are too large to fit
on a CD (~650Mbytes), re-run the script first with a -g option for
better compression and, failing that, with the -2 option to
break up the compressed files.  There will also files in the compressed
directory containing the MD5's and checksum's for all the files.

</OL>

<H1>Revisions to a Release</H1>

A release can be revised by modifying one or more files.  This is
first assigned a revision ID (between 01 and 99), and then the changes
are stored in $TOP/MASTER_## where ## is the revision ID.
The version of the file should be current and must contain all intervening
changes for this file since the base release.  In other words, users
should be able to be current by installing the version in the latest
MASTER_## directory.  The script will ensure that all independent
intervening revisions will be applied.  For example, the third revision
to a release (03) will incorporate the revisions in 01 and 02.
<P>
This model does not support revisions where a file is deleted in the
revision.  An empty replacement can be used in the revision if this
is desired.

<P>
The script is run with the -r option which then produces two sets of
compressed files and directories: UNIXCOMPRESS_##_CHG,
UNIXCOMPRESS_##_FULL, and ISOCOMPRESS_##_CHG and ISOCOMPRESS_##_FULL.
The *CHG directories contain just the changes (and accompanying
documentation) while the *FULL contain the full release with the
modifications.

<P>
Here are the steps involved:

<OL>

<P><LI>Leave the original MASTER and its derivatives (UNIX, ISO, UNIXCOMPRESS
and ISOCOMPRESS) unchanged!

<P><LI>Create the MASTER_## directory under $TOP, where ## is a two
digit revision ID, e.g., MASTER_01, MASTER_03, etc.

<P><LI>Change is cumulative.  All prior changes will be rolled into
the new version by the script.  For example, if you are currently
creating files for revision 03, the changes from MASTER_01 and
MASTER_02 will be copied into the UNIX_03 directory automatically
<EM>in order</EM>, i.e., MASTER_01 before MASTER_02.  The MASTER_03
directory will be as you populated it and is not otherwise modified.
Only the derivative directories: UNIX_03*, ISO_03*, UNIXCOMPRESS_03* and
ISOCOMPRESS_03* will contain the prior revisions.

<P><LI>Create just the structure under MASTER_## to populate the change files
in their proper places.  For example, if MRCXT has changed, create:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER_03
    $VERSION/
        META/
            MRCXT

</PRE>
</FONT>

You do not need to create the full directory structure, though you do
have to have the correct structure for the files you are changing.
Ensure that MRFILES and MRCOLS are updated if need be.

<P><LI>In the MASTER_## directory, copy and update (if needed) the
README.txt (and variants), Copyright_Notice.txt (and variants), and
license.txt (and variants) files.  There should be an updated release.dat
file as well.  You will also need a revision file to explain what changed
in this revision.  This file is called: Revision_##.txt,
where ## is the revision ID.  (Need to document here what content and
format are for this file).

<P><LI>If you are updating Metamorphosys, you will also need the
README_MMS.txt and the MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip files in MASTER_##.  If
you are not updating MetamorphoSys, skip this step.  If you are
<EM>only</EM> updating MetamorphoSys in this revision, you only need
the new MetamorphoSys.$VERSION.zip file, README_MMS.txt and the
documentation files described above.  The directory structure below
MASTER_## is not needed.
Be aware that the presence or absence of the MetamorphoSys files
is the trigger for whether or not you want to update MetamorphoSys.
If these files are not present, the latest versions (found by scanning prior
revisions or the MASTER) is used for the "full" revised release.

<P><LI>For example to update just MRCXT:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

$TOP/MASTER_03

    README.txt (optional pdf and html))
    Copyright_Notice.txt (optional pdf and html)
    Revision_##.txt (optional pdf and html)
    release.dat

    $VERSION/
        META/
            MRCXT

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>Ensure that the release.dat in MASTER_##
is correct.  It must have the same revision ID and a timestamp. See
(<A HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov/hypermail/nlmreg-folders/nlmreg_0104/0132.html">nlmreg</A>)
for the discussion.

<P><LI>Create a file called "md5" in MASTER_## that has the MD5 checksum of all the
change files.  This can be created with (after ensuring that the right version of
the right files are in place!):

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

cd $TOP/MASTER_##
/site/bin/md5 `/bin/find $VERSION -type f -print` > md5

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>cd to $TOP/MASTER_## run the script (with the -r ##) option as:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>

/site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d /d21/2002AA -v 2002AA -t 200103010701 -r 03 -p

</PRE>
</FONT>

<P><LI>This should create the following directories in $TOP:
ISOCOMPRESS_03_CHG, ISOCOMPRESS_03_FULL, UNIXCOMPRESS_03_CHG and
UNIXCOMPRESS_03_FULL among others.
These will contain the files: 2002AA_C03.ZIP, 2002AA_F03.ZIP,
2002AA_C03.TGZ and 2002AA_F03.TGZ resp.  The "C" in the file name
refers to the change-only release while the "F" is a full release with
the changes.  The two digits following is the revision ID.  If the -2
option is further specified, multiple compressed files are
created for the "full" release (e.g., 2002AA_1_F03.ZIP and
2002AA_2_F03.ZIP).  The changes will always be in a single file.

<P><LI>The change files is put up on the KSS with appropriate instructions
on how to download and unpack, while the full file can overwrite the
original release file, so new downloads pick up the changes.

<P><LI>All post-release steps must be taken with the new "full"
version (e.g., test MetamorphoSys, load MySQL database, generate URIS
information, etc).

<P><LI>If the changes are very minor (e.g., 5 lines in MRCXT were added),
then you may want to independently provide just the added lines in
a separate file for knowledgeable users to download and apply to their
release.  This must come with its own documentation.  This was done for
2003AA when some ICD9CM contexts were missing from MRCXT and MRREL.
</OL>

<H1>Files in the $MASTER Directory</H1>

This section describes files that need to be present in the $MASTER
directory before a release can be made.
<P>
The text files may optionally have an HTML and a PDF version.
All the text files are copied by script to: the compressed directories,
the release's DOC directory.
