<H1>Managing AH bins</H1>

The AH bins in the EMS are driven by a configuration file in smis:/d3/ems/config.
The default config file is named <A HREF="AH.config">AH.config</A>.
If there is a DB specific
file named AH.config.&lt;db&gt;, e.g., AH.config.ob_mid2001 then that takes
precedence for that database.

<P>

Each line in the file contains several '|' separated fields which are
described below.
Comment lines start with a '#' and blank lines are allowed.

<P>
<B>NOTE</B>:
Please make changes to this file with care.  Changes made to this
file are instrumental in the behavior of the AH bins scheme.

<P>

Once the changes are made, call up the AH bins via the EMS.  It will report any
errors it finds.
Fix them IMMEDIATELY, else the scheme will not work.

<P>

The field formats are:

<OL>

<LI><B>bin_name</B>: The name of the bin.  Bin names are made up of lowercase
alphabetic and numeric characters and the "_" (underscore) character
and must be less than 32 characters long.

<P>

<LI><B>Description</B>: A short, pithy description for the bin.
The description should be less than 240 chars.

<P>

<LI><B>Generator Script</B>: This field contains the name of a script that is
used to generate the clustered set of
concepts for this bin and its arguments (optional).  Scripts reside in
smis:/site/umls/oracle/ems-2.0/AH.
When making worklists, concepts are basically ordered by cluster ID,
and clustered by the generating script, so no ordering script is needed.
<P>
If the field begins with MEME_INTEGRITY_PROC: then the generator is
the named integrity procedure.

<P>
If it begins with FILE:, then the
contents of the bin are assumed to come from the named file (has to be
a full path name, e.g., FILE:/d3/rpts/02/foo.rpt).  Please ensure that
the file contains one or two fields per line with either a concept_id
or a concept_id|cluster_id pair.  Also, since this is a statically generated
list, you will want to set the "track history" attribute to L or G.  Without
that, concepts on worklists that have been stamped will be put on new worklists
made from the bin.

<P>
If it begins with TABLE:, then the EMS expects a table name following the colon
that must have the column: concept_id and optionally cluster_id.  This table
forms the basis of the contents of this bin.  E.g., TABLE:Bad_merges
In some cases, the table seems inaccessible because only the MTH user has
read privileges.  In these cases, either have Apelon give everyone read
permission or prefix the table name with "MTH.", e.g., TABLE:MTH.Bad_merges.

<P>
Some AH queries (e.g., Missed Synonymy, take days to generate.  So these are
pregenerated into a file.  The generator script simply concatenates these
file(s).  So be aware that the information returned by the generator script
may not always be fresh.

<P>

For information about using the STY and word combination script to create an AH bin,
<A HREF="stywrd.html">see here</A>.

<P>

<LI><B>Order Script</B>: This field is NOT USED so should be left empty.  See above.

<P>

<LI><B>Contents</B>: This field tells the EMS whether the contents of the bin are known to be
chemicals (C), non-chemicals (N) or a mixture (M).  If M, the bin is split
in to chem and nonchem components.

<P>

<LI><B>Chem Algo</B>: For mixed chem/nonchem bins, this field tells the EMS how a cluster
of concepts should be classified as a chemical or non-chemical.  Allowed values are:
A (a cluster is chemical if ALL concepts have chemical STYs), or O (a cluster is a chemical
if any ONE concept has a chemical STY).  This can be left empty and defaults to A.

<P>

<LI><B>Track History</B>: AH bins have history, i.e., once a set of
concepts in a cluster have been reviewed for a purpose, they need not
be looked at again for the same purpose whether or not they meet the
inclusion criteria for the bin.  Allowed values are: G (history is
GLOBAL, i.e., spans all editing epochs going back to the dawn of
time) - this is the default, or L (history is LOCAL, i.e., if the
cluster is present in a worklist made from this bin in the CURRENT
EDITING EPOCH), or N (no history whatsoever).  The N case should only
be used for testing, otherwise it should be an L.  The L prevents
concepts from being reedited in the case when a worklist is stamped
and a new one is made without regenerating the bin.  One off lists of
concepts to edit can be made into AH bins with track_history of L.
