release files to the PC - use binary ftp to&nbsp;these directories &nbsp;(ftp is much faster than sftp or SecureFx)</li>  <li>&nbsp;ZIP files: </li></ul><ul style="margin-left: 40px;">  <li>&nbsp;

use ftp's cd to go to the ISOCOMPRESS directory - e.g. cd /d21/2003AA/ISOCOMPRESS</li>  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; ls to be sure you see the correct files</li>  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; issue these commands: prompt;

DO include the 2003AA_1.ZIP file.<br><br>Enter the disc name e.g. 2003AA_1_ZIP<br><br>Select File -&gt; CD Project Properties<br>Under the General Tab:<br>select File System: Joliet<br>check Automatiacally Verify File System after Recording<br>check Record using a single data track only<br>select Mode 1 CDROM<br>DO not check Automatically import... or Validate source files before recording<br><br>Under the File System Tab:<br>Enter Publisher Name: NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE <br>(leave other fileds blank - they are not used and don't work correctly)<br>select 'Use this date/time' and enter the official release date<br><br>Under the File Types Tab:<br>select Add all Files<br><br>Click OK to close the CD Properties window<br><br>File-&gt;Record CD<br>Be sure to check 'Buffer underrun prevention'<br>Set Number of Copies: 1<br>Be sure to set Write Speed to correct value for your writer - this does not autodetect correctly<br>click 'Start Recording' THEN insert blank CD-R when requested.<br><br>WAIT until this CD-R is successfully created and validated.<br>Save the project as the disc name (e.g. 2003AA_1_ZIP).<br>Label the CD-R withthe disc name and 'MASTER #1' (Use ONLY a CD marking pen) <br><h5>Second ZIP disc:</h5>The second ZIP disc is made exactly as above, &nbsp;except this disc includes the second ZIP file and excludes the first:<br>&nbsp;e.g. include the  2003AA_2.ZIP file and omit the&nbsp; 2003AA_1.ZIP file, which is already on the first disc).<br><br><h4>TAR MASTER CD-Rs:</h4>Tar discs are made exactly as the Zip discs, except the files come from the TAR directory (e.g. c:\2003AA_TAR)<br>and include all files on each CD-R except for 2003AA_2.TGZ on the first disc, and 2003AA_1.TGZ on the second disc.<br><br><h3>Testing and copying the Master CDRs:</h3>Use the check-cd-md5s.pl script (see http://metanews.nlm.nih.gov/ems/doc/check-masters.html)<br>to validate each master CD-R, then <br>Use EZ CD Creators' Disc Copier to make two copies of each disk.<br>then check each copy with the check-cd-md5s.pl script.<br>Label copies withthe Disc name and "MASTER #2" and "MASTER #3"<br><br><h3>Sending and storing Master CD-Rs:</h3>Hand off copies of MASTER #2 for shipping to the CD-ROM producer.<br>Keep MASTER #1 in the permanent archive, and store MASTER #3 for use <br>if the production masters are lost or damaged.<br><br>You're Done! &nbsp;<br></body></html>
