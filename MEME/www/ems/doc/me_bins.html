<H1>Managing ME bins</H1>

The ME bins in the EMS are driven by a configuration file in smis:/d3/ems/config.
The default config file is named <A HREF="ME.config">ME.config</A>.  If there is a DB specific
file named ME.config.&lt;db&gt;, e.g., ME.config.ob_mid2001 then that takes
precedence for that database.  This is useful for testing insertions on
a test database and is used for that reason.

<P>

Each line in the file contains several '|' separated fields which are
described below.
Comment lines start with a '#' and blank lines are allowed.

<P>
<B>NOTE</B>:
Please make changes to this file with care.  Changes made to this
file are instrumental in the behavior of the ME bins scheme.
For instance, do not delete the lines for any of the pre-defined ME bins.
These are clearly marked in the configuration file.

<P>

Once the changes are made, call up the ME bins via the EMS.  It will report any
errors it finds.
Fix them IMMEDIATELY, else the scheme will not work.

<P>

The field formats are:

<OL>

<LI><B>bin_name</B>: The name of the bin.  Bin names are made up of lowercase
alphabetic and numeric characters and the "_" (underscore) character
and must be less than 32 characters long.
NOTE: the names of some bins are standardized and these
are prefixed by the label: "DO NOT CHANGE THESE".  Do NOT change those!
The current standard set is: demotions, norelease, reviewed, embryos, noreview, leftovers.
The order of bins is also important.  Hence the 'leftovers' bin must be the last
defined bin.  User bins go in between these pre-defined bins.  Example: meddra31,
icdproc, missyn, etc.

<P>

Bin names should be all lowercase upto a maximum of 32 chars.  Try to use meaningful
names.  If the bin is organized by a specific source (most common), use the source name
in the bin, e.g., icd2000.  Note that bin names do not need the 'wrk' prefix like
in MEME-2, that is automatically tacked on to worklists made from this bin.

<P>

<LI><B>Editable</B>: This field should have a Y or a N for whether the bin is editable or not.
User defined bins should always be Y so that worklists can be made from them.

<P>

<LI><B>Description</B>: A short, pithy description for the bin.  I usually steal this
from the source description file on meow that is maintained by the folks that do
the inversion.  The description should be less than 240 chars.

<P>

<LI><B>Generator Script</B>: This field contains the name of a script that is used
to generate the set of concepts for this bin and optionally, its arguments.
<P>
All generator scripts:

<OL>
<P><LI>gen_source.pl (generates concepts by source/termgroup criteria).
Concepts with atoms from any source or termgroup is retrieved.  This is the
workhorse query for ME bins.
<PRE>
Options are: -s (comma separated versioned SABs)
             -R (single ROOT SAB)
             -r (comma separated versioned termgroups)
Examples:

gen_source.pl -s 'MDREX,MDR41,MDRAE,MDREA'
gen_source.pl -R 'SNOMEDCT'
gen_source.pl -r 'MTH/PN'

</PRE>

<P><LI>gen_order_id.pl (generates by ranges of order_id in the ATOM_ORDERING table).
This was mainly intended for SNOMEDCT editing.
<PRE>
Options are: -s (versionless SAB)
             -F (begining order_id)
             -T (ending order_id)
Examples:

gen_order_id.pl -s SNOMEDCT -F 1170247 -T 1205774

</PRE>
<P><LI>gen_sty.pl (generates concepts by source and STY).
Concepts with any of the STYs specified and any of the sources
specified are extracted.  For the -s option, case is not important,
but make sure the semantic type names are spelled correctly.
Also, use quotes around the argument since they tend to have
spaces.  Both -s and -T have to be specified.
<PRE>
Options are: -s (comma separated list of versioned/versionless SABs)
             -T (comma separated list of semantic types or T numbers)

Example:

gen_sty.pl -s SNOMEDCT -T T009
gen_sty.pl -s SNOMEDCT -T 'disease or syndrome'

</PRE>
</OL>

<P>

<LI><B>Order Script</B>: This field contains the name of a script that orders and
optionally clusters the
concepts in the bin on the way to making worklists and checklists.
Obviously not needed for un-editable bins from which worklists or checklists
cannot be made.
Bin sorting hints are in the source information page maintained by the
inversion folks.
I have a useful set of these scripts already implemented and these should suffice
for most purposes.  They are: order_treenum.pl, order_code.pl, order_alpha.pl,
order_mesh.pl.

<P>

<DL>
<DT>order_treenum.pl
<DD>Orders concepts according to a treenum file that Apelon provides.  This file
is the best sort order for editing as determined by the folks that inverted the
source.  The information is obtained from the source info page.
The treenum file format is: source_atom_id|some sort field.
Command line options are:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>-t &lt;full path to treenums file&gt; these files usually live in smis:/d3/rpts/&lt;yy&gt;.
<LI>-s &lt;source name(s)&gt; Comma separated if multiple SABs.
<LI>-n forces a numeric sort on the second field
</UL>
<P>
<DT>order_code.pl
<DD>Some sources are best ordered by code.  Use this script for that.  Specify
the source name in the -s option, e.g., -s MTHICD9.  This option is required since
code is a source-specific attribute.

<DT>order_alpha.pl
<DD>This is a fall back ordering scheme.  It orders the concepts by the
alphabetically on the atom name of one or more sources.  Specify
the source name in the -s option, e.g., -s MTHICD9.  This option is required since
this is source-specific.

<DT>order_mesh.pl
<DD>Well, MeSH is special.  It is ordered by the tree number which is the MN attribute.
No options are needed. It finds the current version of MeSH from the source_version table.

<DT>order_order_id.pl
<DD>Orders by the order_id field in the ATOM_ORDERING table.
</DL>

<P>

If you want to test a order script without having to repartition the ME bins,
you can do so by calling these scripts directly.  They read in a list of concept_id's
and output them in sort order, so you need to extract a list of matching concepts to
feed the script (using the dump_table.pl script) and feed the output to make_checklist.pl
to see what the ordering really looks like.

<P>

For example, let us assume you want to test the ordering script for source MMX01
(with bin name of 'mmx01') from database oc_testsrc:

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<PRE>
/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -d oc_testsrc -q "select concept_id from ems_me_bins where bin_name='mmx01'" |
/site/umls/oracle/ems/ME/order_treenum.pl -d oc_testsrc -s MMX01 -t /d3/rpts/02/worklist.sortkey.MMX01 |
head -200 |
/site/umls/oracle/wms/scripts/make-checklist.pl -d oc_testsrc
</PRE>
</FONT>
<P>

<LI><B>Contents</B>: This field tells the EMS whether the contents of the bin are known to be
chemicals (C), non-chemicals (N) or a mixture (M).  If M, the bin is split
in to chem and nonchem components.

<P>

<LI><B>Chem Algo</B>: For mixed chem/nonchem bins, this field tells the EMS how a cluster
of concepts should be classified as a chemical or non-chemical.  Allowed values are:
A (a cluster is chemical if ALL concepts have chemical STYs), or O (a cluster is a chemical
if any ONE concept has a chemical STY).  This can be left empty and defaults to A.
