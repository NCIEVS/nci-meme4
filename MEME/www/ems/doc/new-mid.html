<H1>Starting a New MID</H1>

<UL>
<P><LI>
Once editing has been frozen in preparation for a release, Apelon, coordinating
with NLM, will create and initialize a new MID on the production machine.
The EMS tables (all tables with name like ems_% or wms_% in the meow schema) should
have been copied over
(<A HREF="/cgi-oracle-nlmlti/ems.pl?action=table_help&owner=MEOW&likenot=like&subaction=list&like=ems_%">Were they?</A>).

<P><LI>
Once the DB is ready, start a new editing epoch <A HREF="changing-epoch.html">as described here</A>.

<P><LI>
Once that is done, editing can begin after a matrix init and a repartition assuming you
have configured the <A HREF="me_bins.html">ME bins</A>, <A HREF="qa_bins.html">QA bins</A>,
etc. as needed.
