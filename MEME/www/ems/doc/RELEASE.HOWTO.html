How to make release files and QA:
--------------------------------

Introduction:
------------

The release files are normally made on wthsun and start with the
contents in a master directory and end with the TGZ (the tar,
gzip compressed file for UNIX) and the ZIP (pkzip file for Windows).
The only exceptions is that the following files are unpacked from
a different directory:

README.MMS (the MetamorphoSys README file)
MetamorphoSysUnix.zip (the UNIX MetamorphoSys)
MetamorphoSysWin.zip (the Windows MetamorphoSys)

The name of the script is /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl.
The directory structure it expects is as follows:

- The top directory called TOP where everything is installed,
  e.g., /d21/2000.

- These directories are assumed to exist: {TOP}/MASTER, {TOP}/UNIX,
  {TOP}/ISO, {TOP}/ZIP, {TOP}/TAR.  When the release script is run,
  their contents are removed and fresh data installed.  The {TOP}/MASTER
  is the master directory that has the latest, *verified* data in the
  right structure.

- When the process ends, the {TOP}/ZIP contains the ZIP image and
  {TOP}/TAR contains the TGZ image of the Metathesaurus.


The process:
-----------

The script logic is briefly summarized below:

- The UNIX directory is populated with the contents of the MASTER
  directory; the permissions on the files and directories are set to 644
  and 755 respectively, and the timestamp is set to the value specified
  in the script (usually Jan 1).  The README and CPYRIGHT files are
  additionally copied from the MASTER/DOC directory to the top level
  directory (UNIX/UMLS<year>).

  The {TOP}/MetamorphoSysUnix.zip file is unzip'ed into
  UNIX/UMLS<year>/META.  It is assumed that this zip file is zip'ed with
  the METAMSYS directory at the root.  Also, its contents must already
  have the right permissions as these are not affected by the
  master2dist.pl script.  The {TOP}/README.MMS is copied into the right
  places under UNIX (DOC, META/METAMSYS).

- The ISO contents are created from the UNIX directory by recursively
  running text files through unix2dos.  Perl's -B test is used to decide
  what is text or binary.  The permissions and timestamp are set as
  before and the README and CPYRIGHT are copied (after the unix2dos
  transformation).

  The MetamorphoSysWin.zip file is then unzip'ed in the right place.
  Same caveats as for the UNIX version.  The {TOP}/README.MMS is
  run through unix2dos and places in the right places.

- The contents of the UNIX directory are then piped through tar and gzip
  to create the TGZ file in the {TOP}/TAR directory.  Note that because
  the intermediate files are > 2G, this has to be piped.  The README and
  CPYRIGHT files are copied to the TAR directory as well and the
  checksum and MD5 values are computed in TAR (but not released).

- The contents of the ISO directory are ZIP'ed the create the ZIP file
  for the distribution.  There are a couple of complications.  First,
  there are two ZIP files in the distribution since the single one
  exceeds the capacity of a CD.  Currently MRCXT is by itseld in the
  second ZIP while everything else is in the first.  Secondly, because
  of the multiple, incompatible ZIP programs (Winzip, pkzip, zip, gzip,
  etc), the zip process has traditionally been done on the PC using
  PKZIP.  So the master2dist.pl script makes intermediate tgz (small
  _tgz_) files that mirror the ZIP versions.  These were then FTP'ed to
  a PC and PKZIP'ed and FTP'ed back to the {TOP}/ZIP directory.

  The master2dist.pl, however, also makes the Unix versions of the ZIP's
  using the zip program from www.cdrom.com.  Preliminary tests indicate
  that this is indeed compatible with the PC versions, but for 2000 the
  data was still ZIP'ed on the PC.  All these files (intermediate tgz,
  Unix ZIP) are deposited in the ZIP directory (but not released).  The
  correct ZIP files then go into the {TOP}/ZIP/UM<year>.ZIP directory.

NOTE: If the MR* files grow to the point that a different break up of
the files is required, the script will need to be recoded.


How to RUN:
----------

1) Ensure that the MASTER directory contents are correct and verified.
   I.e., LTI's delivery of the MR* files, Alexa/Olivier's NET, Guy's
   LEX content must have been tested and certified.  The contents of
   MASTER directory are not modified, so the timestamps on the files,
   directories, etc can be tracked.

2) The latest MetamorphoSys*.zip and README.MMS files from LTI must
   be verified (esp. important are file permissions and config file
   settings) and copied over to {TOP}.

3) The master2dist.pl script must be modified to run for the new release.
   The $timestamp, $subdir, $prefix, @dirstruct should esp be checked.
   If the distribution requirements need a different break up of files
   to fit on multiple CDs, the code will need to be changed.

4) Then as user 'wth', run:

   /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d {TOP} >& master2dist.log

   This will take ~3 hours to run and populate the ZIP and TAR directories
   as described above.  If the ZIP's are made on the PC, do that and restore
   them to the correct place under {TOP}/ZIP/

   Scan the log file for the string "ERROR" (grep -i).

5) Then make the CD images from the TAR/UMLS2000.TAR and ZIP/UMLS2000.ZIP
   directories and test the result.

6) Test MetamorphoSys from the CD image on Solaris, Linux, NT and Win98 and
   create 1) default subset, 2) remove all sources, 3) remove no source,
   4) remove single source, etc.  All of the following Q/A scripts can be run
   on the the resulting subsetted Metathesaurus files.  Fix any errors
   found and go to 1).  Repeat as often as necessary :-).



Scripts for Testing and Q/A:
---------------------------

There are additional helper scripts that are used to test the veracity
of directories and files.  All report errors with the string ERROR in
the output.

1) /site/bin/md5 can be used to verify that a two supposedly identical files
   are indeed so.  E.g.

	/site/bin/md5 < {TOP}/ZIP/UM2000_1.tgz

2) Given two directories that contain the same contents, except that one has
   Unix line-terminated text files and the other DOS line-terminated text
   files, the script /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl can be used to recursively
   compare the contents.  The script accounts for the line termination and
   reports errors.  It takes a path to the Unix version in the -u option
   and a DOS version in the -d option.  If both versions have the same line
   termination, the -n option disables the unix2dos conversion.  The -e
   option has directories (recursive) that you want to ignore in the comparison,
   e.g., METAMSYS.  For example:

   /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000 -d {TOP}/ISO/UMLS2000 -e METAMSYS

   Compare previous and current UNIX directories:

   /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000 -d {TOP}/UNIX.old/UMLS2000 -n

   The script assumes that the directory in the -u option is the master.  Any files found
   there but not in the -d option are reported.  The -r option reverses the sense of this.
   So you normally want to run both ways.  E.g.,

   /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000 -d {TOP}/ISO/UMLS2000 -e METAMSYS
   /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000 -d {TOP}/ISO/UMLS2000 -e METAMSYS -r

3) To ensure that MR files have the correct sort order and there are no duplicate lines,
   run the script /site/umls/release/mrorder.pl as:

   /site/umls/release/mrorder.pl -d {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000/META

4) The cuiqa.pl script checks all MR files for intra-file CUI consistency.  It assumes
   the MRCON, MRSO, MRSTY, MRXW.ENG, MRXNS.ENG, MRXNW.ENG have >0 rows for every CUI.
   It reports errors if for example, MRCON has a CUI that is not found in MRSO.
   It then checks the CUI fields in other files to ensure that these CUIs are actually
   present in the files above.  It currently checks MRREL (fields 1,3), MRATX (1),
   MRCOC (1, 3), MRCXT (1), MRDEF (1), MRLO (1), MRSAT (1).  Others can be added as
   needed by editing the script.  Run as, for example:

   /site/umls/release/cuiqa.pl -d {TOP}/UNIX/UMLS2000/META

   Errors are reported to stdout.

5) The script make-small-meta.pl makes a self-contained "small" Metathesaurus and takes
   a list of CUI's to include (or uses a built in default 7 CUIs) and the path to the
   full Metathesaurus.  If extracts the transitive closure for these CUIs from all the
   MR files and makes the subset.  It is very useful for testing scripts that would
   take inordinately long on the full Metathesaurus.
