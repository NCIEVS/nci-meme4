Tammy,

OK, I have a multipurpose query for this in
/site/umls/oracle/ems-2.1/QA/snmfnsty.pl

It takes these options:

-d <database>
-p <pattern> for the SNOMEDCT/FN parenthesized term, e.g., finding
-s <one or more comma separated STYs>

If neither the -p nor the -s options are specified, it
produces a list of SNOMEDCT/FN parenthesized words and their
counts.

It only the -p option is used, it produces a count of all the
STY's for this pattern.

If both -p and -s are specified it produces a list of the matching
concept IDs that contain FNs with that pattern and that STY. In this
form, it can be used as an EMS QA or AH query.

EXAMPLE:

First get a list of all possible parenthesized patterns in FN's:

snmfnsty.pl -d oc_testsrc

(disorder)|73172
(procedure)|47280
(finding)|40108
(body structure)|25831
(organism)|24772
(substance)|22085
(product)|17147
...

Now get the STY distribution of concepts that contain the "finding"
pattern (the parens are optional):

snmfnsty.pl -p finding -d oc_testsrc

...
Food|28
...
Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure|390
Pathologic Function|537
Functional Concept|547
Classification|884
Disease or Syndrome|947
Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction|1149
Laboratory or Test Result|1793
Sign or Symptom|2151
Injury or Poisoning|8934
Finding|20063

And finally to get the 28 concept_ids for the pattern "finding" with
STY "Food",

snmfnsty.pl -p finding -s Food -d oc_testsrc

13782
42993

43032
43033
43034
43035
43036
43037

187543
187573
275817
428390
486873
1019832
8793405
8793439
8793461
8793580

One example:

CN# 187461 High carbohydrate diet (finding)
CUI C0259835 Concept Status is Reviewed
STY Food R
ATOMS
R [] High carbohydrate diet (finding)
[SNOMEDCT_2003_07_31/FN/226120004]
