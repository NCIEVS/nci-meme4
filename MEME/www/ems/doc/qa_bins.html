<H1>Managing QA bins</H1>

The QA bins in the EMS are driven by a configuration file in smis:/d3/ems/config.
The default config file is named <A HREF="QA.config">QA.config</A>.  If there is a DB specific
file named QA.config.&lt;db&gt;, e.g., QA.config.ob_mid2001 then that takes
precedence for that database.  This is rarely needed.

<P>

Each line in the file contains several '|' separated fields which are
described below.
Comment lines start with a '#' and blank lines are allowed.

<P>
<B>NOTE</B>:
Please make changes to this file with care.  Changes made to this
file are instrumental in the behavior of the QA bins scheme.

<P>

Once the changes are made, call up the QA bins via the EMS.  It will report any
errors it finds.

<P>

The field formats are:

<OL>

<LI><B>bin_name</B>: The name of the bin.  Bin names are made up of lowercase
alphabetic and numeric characters and the "_" (underscore) character
and must be less than 32 characters long.

<P>

<LI><B>Description</B>: A short, pithy description for the bin.
The description should be less than 240 chars.

<P>

<LI><B>Generator Script</B>: This field contains the name of a script that is used
to generate the clustered set of
concepts for this bin and optionally, the script's arguments.  If the name starts
with "MEME_INTEGRITY_PROC." then this is assumed to be implemented
internally in MEME-3 and Apelon is responsible for maintaining it.
Otherwise the script resides in smis:/site/umls/oracle/ems-2.0/QA.

<P>
If it begins with FILE:, then the
contents of the bin are assumed to come from the named file (has to be
a full path name, e.g., FILE:/d3/rpts/02/foo.rpt).  Please ensure that
the file contains one or two fields per line with either a concept_id
or a concept_id|cluster_id pair.

<P>
If it begins with TABLE:, then the EMS expects a table name following the colon
that must have the column: concept_id and optionally cluster_id.  This table
forms the basis of the contents of this bin.  E.g., TABLE:NDF_merges
Sometimes, the table does not have a public synonym.  Either have Apelon
or Joe add a public synonym or prefix the table name with the schema name
as MTH.NDF_merges.  Here's how to check to see if a table is accessible without the
schema name (make sure to use the correct table name and database):

<PRE>

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -t "NCBI2001_merges" -d oa_mid2002 | wc -l

If that works, then just use the table name as is in QA.config.

If that dies with an illuminative error message like:

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -t "NCBI2001_merges" -d oa_mid2002 | wc -l
Can't call method "execute" on an undefined value at /site/umls/oracle/utils/oracleIF.pl line 187.
       0

Try it with MTH as:

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -t "NCBI2001_merges" -d oa_mid2002 -u MTH | wc -l

If that works, then use MTH.<table> in QA.config.

<P>

When making worklists, concepts are basically ordered by cluster ID,
and clustered by the generating script, so no ordering script is needed.

<P>

For information about using the STY and word combination script to create a QA bin,
<A HREF="stywrd.html">see here</A>.

<LI><B>Contents</B>: This field tells the EMS whether the contents of the bin are known to be
chemicals (C), non-chemicals (N) or a mixture (M).  If M, the bin is split
in to chem and nonchem components.

<P>

<LI><B>Chem Algo</B>: For mixed chem/nonchem bins, this field tells the EMS how a cluster
of concepts should be classified as a chemical or non-chemical.  Allowed values are:
A (a cluster is chemical if ALL concepts have chemical STYs), or O (a cluster is a chemical
if any ONE concept has a chemical STY).  This can be left empty and defaults to A.
