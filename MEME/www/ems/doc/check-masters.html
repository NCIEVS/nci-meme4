<H1>Checking the master CDs</H1>

This should be the last check on the content of the CD once it comes
back from the CD mastering shop.  This ensures that what is in the
CD is in fact identical to what went in when the CD-R's were made
at NLM.  This is not a semantic check of the content, obviously.
See also: <A HREF="compare-meta.html">compare-meta.pl</A>.

<p>

Typically, there are 4 CD's: 2 ZIP's and 2 TAR's each containing
content named with a specific convention.  For example, the 2002AD_2.ZIP
file goes into a CD with the label 2002AD_2_ZIP.  The label and the content
should match.

<P>
Also, there is a file with the extension "MD5" (or "md5") that contains
the MD5 checksums of all the files that go into the distribution at the
time the release is made.  If you can check that the actual MD5's
of the files on the CD are the same, then you can rest easy that
no bit got left behind in the mad rush to make the release.

<P>

Here's a tool that automates this: /site/umls/release/check-cd-md5s.pl.
You pop in each CD (one at a time) into the CD-ROM drive on a Sun
or a Mac (OS-X) machine.  Then run this script with the -v option specifying the
release name, e.g., -v 2003AA.  It should produce some output on the
screen.  Look for the word "error" indicating problems.

<P>
For example:

<PRE>

/site/umls/release/check-cd-md5s.pl -v 2003AA

</PRE>

For Mac's, use the -c option to specify the CD-ROM mount point and
pass the script as an argument to perl as in:

<PRE>

perl check-cd-md5s.pl -v 2003AA -c /Volumes

</PRE>

Some things to keep in mind:

<UL>
<P><LI>When you put in a CD, it takes a few minutes for the
automounter to mount the device.  So give it a few seconds
before running the script.
<P><LI>The Solaris CD device driver does not know about long
file names so it truncates everything to a dumb 8.3 format
like DOS (e.g., readme~1.txt).  It is in fact even dumber than
that.  It lowercases the file name too.  So it is hard to know
that "copyri~1.txt" is in fact the same as "Copyright_Notice.txt".
<P>
So the script matches MD5's and reports the matching file names
(the real and the munged).  Mismatches or missing files are reported
as errors.
<P>
On Mac's file names are correct.
<P><LI>
Currently, this has to be run on a Sun with a CD-ROM drive and
access to our software in /site.  Any of the machines on the 9th
floor can be used for this.
The program should ideally be written in Java so this can be done on
a Billy machine as well. <P>Volunteers?
