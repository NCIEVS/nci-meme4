> Subject: Documentation update script is wthsun:/d21/QA/update.MASTER.docs.s

The script location was in the subject line - here is a more extensive set
of instructions for the record. 

I just ran the script because it needs to be run as wth.  You can ask Joe
to 'su' you to do this any time until we decide to change permissions so
you can do it without the su. OK for next time? 

I haven't finished the What's New - there was a major problem about
the Pubmed mapping files, so I made them and need to hand off to Stuart
- hopefully this AM after Suresh and I can double chcek.

I will be in late morning...

thanks, Bill

HOW TO UPDATE THE MASTER DOC DIRECTORY

This is necessary to ensure that the UMLSDOC.TXT file is updated
correctly. Other html, gif, and pdf are simply copied.

Release production is currently done on wthsun.

The 'ReleaseDir' is /d21/<version>, for example /d21/2002AA/

The TEMPDOCS file is /d21/<ReleaseDir>/TEMPDOCS, for example
/d21/2002AA/TEMPDOCS/

The script is: 
  /d21/QA/update.MASTER.docs.s

If you give the command without parameters, it reminds you what you need
to add to actually run it, i.e.: 
=======
wthsun:/d21/QA/ update.MASTER.docs.s
 
  ### NOT RUN 
  * Usage: update.MASTER.docs.s ReleaseDir Version 
    - e.g. /d21/QA/update.MASTER.docs.s /d21/2002AA 2002AA >&!
/d21/QA/update.MASTER.docs.s.log
  * Updates MASTER DOC directory and remakes UMLSDOC.TXT, from
ReleaseDir/TEMPDOCS 
  * Run each time any documentation files are changed there 
 
 ** WARNING: ReleaseDir/README.MMS, MASTER...DOC/CPYRIGHT and
README WIN!  
             master2dist.pl replaces UNIX and ISO copies when run. 
  ### Be sure to check the log file for errors! 
========
