With the lvg2005 release, LVG does not need a database backend
to store the LVG tables.  It uses HSqlDb ("Hyper" SQL DB) that
uses file-based indexing and searching and is reasonably fast.

<P>
With this, I've created new code to simplify installation, etc.
Here are the steps to follow:

<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Download the full lexical distribution.  This is usually
called LEX.tgz and should contain the lexicon and other data
along with the lvg tools.  The unpacked LEX.tgz is what forms
the contents of the LEX subdirectory of a UMLS release.

<P><LI>In the LEX_PGMS subdirectory is the content for the LVG
tools (norm, luinorm, etc).  Unpack this (with gzip, gtar) in
smis:/d4/lvg.  This should create the versioned directory name
such as lvg2005.

<P><LI>Follow the installation directions for this version
(usually there's an install subdirectory).  After installation,
you should see the bin directory containing the programs we use.

<P><LI>To allow access from other servers, we need to either
rdist this directory to other machines, or create NFS links.
I have opted for the latter for now, so /site/package/lvg/lvg2005
is a link to /net/smis/c6/d4/lvg/lvg2005.  If you do this,
make sure you edit the wrapper scripts (norm, luiNorm, etc)
in the bin directory to make these NFS paths.  For example,
change:

<CODE>
JAVA=/c6/umls/d4/lvg/lvg2005/bin/j2re1.4.2_05/bin/java

to

JAVA=/net/smis/c6/umls/d4/lvg/lvg2005/bin/j2re1.4.2_05/bin/java
</CODE>

Also edit the lvg.properties file in data/config to make the
paths NFS accessible.

<P><LI>The server scripts are in /site/umls/lvg/hsqldbserver.
LVGServer.pl can be called on the new version with the -v option.
Test locally with the -f option and as a server on a different
port, say 50000.  Use /site/umls/lvg/cluinorm.pl as a test client
(with the -p option).

<P><LI>When all is happy, set the /site/package/lvg/current to
point to the new version.  Test one final time with
/site/umls/lvg/cluinorm.pl.

</OL>

<P>
The LVG team gives us a new release of LVG annually (fall).
We use LVG in MEME to assign LUIs, compute STT and for flexible
matching during insertion and Q/A.

<P>

As of 2002, LVG was reimplemented in Java.  The tables that LVG uses
can be in memory (IDB), MySQL or Oracle.  The LVG distribution comes
with load classes and configuration information for IDB and MySQL.
With some tweaking we were successful in porting to Oracle, which is
what we use since lvg2003.  The retrieval side works seamlessly in
Oracle (JDBC).

<P>

This document describes how to install LVG with the modifications for
use in the MEME system.  It also describes the LVG server and clients
that we have implemented to interface the LVG system.

</UL>

<H1><A NAME="install">Installation</A></H1>

The LVG distribution is obtained from:

<PRE>
<A HREF="http://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/lvg">http://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/lvg</A>
</PRE>

after we get word from the LVG team that it is ready.
Due to the size of the distribution, it is only installed on machines
that need it, currently smis.  The clients are on all machines.

<P>

<UL>

<P><LI>
So on machines that need LVG (smis, oa, mrd), create the directory:
<PRE>

/site/package/lvg/$VERSION

</PRE>

or link this to where the installation really is.

<P><LI>
On smis, follow the installation directions in:
<A HREF="http://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/lvg/current/docs/userDoc/index.html">Lexical Tools
Documentation</A>.  Answer "no" to the MySQL install.  So you should have the IDB
version installed and we handle the Oracle load and install ourselves.

<P><LI>
Set the link /site/package/lvg/current to point to the current version,
say, /site/package/lvg/lvg2003 if you are satisfied with the installation
process.

<P><LI>
On oa and mrd (and other machines that need direct LVG access), I simply
link to the version on smis for now using NFS and automount.  If this is
not satisfactory, you can install a local copy on these machines.
I do:

<PRE>

oa% ln -s /net/smis/c6/umls/d4/lvg/lvg2003 /site/package/lvg/lvg2003

</PRE>

Copy the lvg.properties (usually in data/config) file to
/site/etc/lvg.  Make Oracle, MySQL and IDB versions of this file
(see examples already there).  Rdist these to all machines.

</UL>
<P>
(<A HREF="#top">Back to table of contents</A>)

<H1><A NAME="prop">Properties files</A></H1>

On the machines that have the servers running, create the following files
in the /site/etc/lvg directory where $V is the current LVG version, e.g.
lvg2004.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>$V.idb.properties
<LI>$V.oracle.properties
</UL>

<P>
The content for these files comes from the $LVGDIR/data/config/lvg.properties file
with changes made to support either IDB or Oracle.
When testing is complete, change the link current.*.properties to the new
versions of these files.
Also, ensure that the files are not world readable (640).

<P>

The master version is maintained on smis.  The rdist file is:
smis:/d4/lvg/etc-dist.  Distribute this to other machines as
root using rdist.

<H1><A NAME="localidb">Local Access to LVG using IDB</A></H1>

If you need the full LVG functionality locally, as for example, to
compute the STT in the release, you can use the IDB database version
directly.  You will need to set the classpath appropriately and use
the Java properties file in /site/etc/lvg/current.idb.properties (this
is a link to the IDB properties file for the current version of LVG).
Here, for example is how you can use luiNorm directly on the mrd
machine (CLASSPATH for LVG2003):

<PRE>

% setenv LVGDIR "/site/package/lvg/current";
% setenv CLASSPATH "
    $LVGDIR/lib/lvg2004api.jar:
    $LVGDIR/lib/lvg2004dist.jar:
    $LVGDIR/lib/jdbcDrivers/IDB/idb.jar:
    $LVGDIR/lib/jdbcDrivers/IDB/jta-spec1_0_1.jar"
% java luiNorm -x:/site/etc/lvg/current.idb.properties -i:/usr/dict/words -o:foo

</PRE>
<P>
Note: using the -i and -o option will assume input and output to be
UTF-8 encoded.  UNIX redirection does not always work.

<P>

NLM will maintain the links: /site/package/lvg/current and /site/etc/lvg/current.idb.properties
so your code doesn't have to change.

<P>
(<A HREF="#top">Back to table of contents</A>)

<H1><A NAME="server">LVG Server</A></H1>

A lightweight server has been written to run on smis (or more
generally on the host name returned by the MID service
lvg-server-host).  It runs on the TCP port returned by the MID service
lvg-server-port.  This server is implemented in Java and uses Oracle
as the repository for LVG data.  The IDB version (used prior to
lvg2003) tends to use a significant amount of memory.  Oracle was
preferrable to MySQL only because we have many machines with Oracle
databases (for redundancy) and it is professionally managed.

<P>

Note: the password for access to the database is obtained from the
data in /etc/umls/oracle.passwd which should be present on the
server host machine.  Also, the password is trivially rotated
using the ROT13 algorithm from accidental disclosure.

<P>

All code related to the server is in the /site/umls/lvg/server
directory.  The server can be run in network or local mode.  The
latter does not incur the network overhead and runs as a UNIX filter
reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT.  It will still use the
network to get to the Oracle database unless that happens to be local
to the machine.  For truly local batch access, use the IDB version
described above.
<P>
A perl script LVGServer.pl
wraps up the Java call with simple options and provides defaults for
the rest or looks them up as needed.

<H2>LVGServer.pl Options</H2>
<DL>
<DT>-d {database}
<DD>The TNS name of the database to use, e.g., oa_mid2003.  Default
is to use the database that the MID service editing-db maps to.
<DT>-v {LVG version}
<DD>the name of an alternate version, e.g., lvg2003; default is "current" version
<DT>-f {norm|luinorm|wordind}
</DD>If you are running locally, you can specify the desired functionality with this.
</DL>

This script can be run as many times as needed (say via cron).  It
detects other running instances and exits gracefully.

<H2>Start up script in /etc/rc3.d</H2>
There is a helper script in /site/umls/lvg/server/S95lvgserver that
can be used to start, stop and restart the LVG server on the default
host and port. It recognizes these single-word arguments:

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5>
<TR><TD>S95lvgserver <B>start</B></TD><TD>Starts the server</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S95lvgserver <B>stop</B></TD><TD>Stops the server</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S95lvgserver <B>restart</B></TD><TD>Stops the server and restarts it.  Use this to restart the
	  server after changing the editing-db MID service.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S95lvgserver <B>pid</B></TD><TD>The PID(s) of the LVG server process.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
There is a link to this script from /etc/rc3.d on smis.

<P>
(<A HREF="#top">Back to table of contents</A>)

<H1><A NAME="clients">Norm/Luinorm/Wordind with Oracle</A></H1>

Some of LVG's functionality such as norm, luinorm and wordind are available
via client programs that use the LVG server.  These clients can be run in the
local mode that bypasses the TCP overhead between client and server.
It is possible that the databases are not on the same machine running the server,
so there will be some hidden overhead due to that.
<P>

There client scripts are in /site/umls/lvg/client.  These are norm.pl, luinorm.pl,
wordind.pl that can be used for local or remote access to LVG data.  These links
are preserved for backward compatability:

<P>
For UNIX,

<PRE>
/site/umls/lvg/cnorm.pl->/site/umls/lvg/client/norm.pl
/site/umls/lvg/cluinorm.pl->/site/umls/lvg/client/luinorm.pl
/site/umls/lvg/cwordind.pl->/site/umls/lvg/client/wordind.pl
</PRE>

<P>
For Windows:
<P>
The FTP site on oa (/d5/MEME3/ftp/pub/NT) has the new versions
of the clients in place of the old names.

<P>
The perl clients take these arguments:

<PRE>

-s {server machine name} default is the name referred to by lvg-server-host
-p {port} default is the port returned by lvg-server-port
-l {run locally without TCP}

</PRE>

Local access will only work on server machines.  In general, use local
access if you have many terms to process, network access if you have a
few.  Tradeoffs are local CPU speed, network speed and Java startup
time, etc.  Your mileage may vary.

<P>
For running the clients locally, you must have access to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>LVG code, specifically the lvg2003api.jar file usually in
/site/package/lvg/current/lib.
<LI>Oracle JDBC driver (usually in $ORACLE_HOME/jdbc/lib/classes12.zip)
<LI>the database containing the LVG tables (usually oa_mid2003 or equivalent)
<LI>contents of /site/umls/lvg/server/*.class
</OL>
<P>
For example, on mrd:

<CODE>

/site/umls/lvg/client/luinorm.pl -l &lt; /usr/dict/words

</CODE>

will luinorm all the words in /usr/dict/words to STDOUT without
the TCP overhead.

<P>

The output of the clients' will contain the query followed by the
remaining fields ('|' separated).  For norm and wordind, which
potentially have a one-to-many response, they are all in the same
line.

<P>
(<A HREF="#top">Back to table of contents</A>)

<H1><A NAME="loading">Loading the LVG tables into Oracle</A></H1>

Currently the MySQL load classes that come with the distribution can be
used to load the data into Oracle with a few changes described below.
<P>
The code that needs to be modified (for loading to Oracle) is currently
in $LVGHOME/loadDb/sources/gov/nih/nlm/nls/lvg/loadDb/MySql/*.java.
Copy these files to /site/umls/lvg/loadDB/$VERSION/.  I usually have
a mirror on astra:~suresh/umls/lvg/loadDB/ where I install and test
before I rdist to /site.

<P>

Edit these files to facilitate the Oracle load.  You can peek in
previous versions to see what needs to be done.  But here is a brief
summary of the changes needed:

<UL>
<P><LI>
Modify DbBase.java to change the MySQL connect string to the Oracle connect string.

<P><LI>
Remove trailing ';' from SQL statements.

<P><LI>

Creating tables and indexing can be done in a single CREATE
statement in MySQL.  In Oracle this needs to be split into two
statements.  So:

<PRE>

  String query = "CREATE TABLE Acronym ("
               + "expNpLc varchar(107) NOT NULL,"
               + "exp     varchar(132) NOT NULL,"
               + "aType    varchar(13),"
               + "acrNpLc varchar(52) NOT NULL,"
               + "acr     varchar(54) NOT NULL)"
               + "INDEX index1(expNpLc),"
               + "INDEX index2(acrNpLc))";

                // execute Sql Query
                db.ExecuteDdl(query);

</PRE>

becomes:

<PRE>

  String query = "CREATE TABLE Acronym ("
               + "expNpLc varchar(107) NOT NULL,"
               + "exp     varchar(132) NOT NULL,"
               + "aType    varchar(13),"
               + "acrNpLc varchar(52) NOT NULL,"
               + "acr     varchar(54) NOT NULL)";

                db.ExecuteDdl(query);

</PRE>

in LoadData followed in main by a calls to create indexes as:

<PRE>

                LoadData(db);
                query = "CREATE INDEX x_Acronym_1 ON Acronym(expNpLc)";
                db.ExecuteDdl(query);
                query = "CREATE INDEX x_Acronym_2 ON Acronym(acrNpLc)";
                db.ExecuteDdl(query);

</PRE>

I also had to put in a System.exit(2) in DbBase.java whenever exceptions are detected.
This will apparently added in the next LVG release.  I also added a conn_.setAutoCommit(true)
in OpenConnection() as there were intermittent errors in the loading or Oracle that
seemed to be related to this.
<P>
I also put in print statements in ExecuteDdl and ExecuteSql in DbBase.java for
diagnosing problems better.

<P><LI>

loadToOracle.pl has these options:

<PRE>

-d {database to load to}
-s {the directory containing the modified source (load classes)
   e.g., /site/umls/lvg/loadDB/lvg2003}
-a (Oracle authentication info, username/password)
-p {package name for the main classes, e.g., gov.nih.nlm.nls.lvg.loadDb.MySql}
-l LVG directory, e.g., /d4/lvg/lvg2003
-v {Oracle driver - default is oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver}

</PRE>

For example:

<PRE>

/site/umls/lvg/loadToOracle.pl
  -s /site/umls/lvg/loadDB/lvg2003
  -d ob_mid2003
  -a lvg/*******
  -l /site/package/lvg/lvg2003
  -p gov.nih.nlm.nls.lvg.loadDb.MySql

</PRE>

This should report progress to STDERR and take an hour or so to load
all the tables.  Make sure to run this against all databases that
are in use, esp. ones on oa, ob.  Note that these runs can be made
in parallel.  Save the output to a log file or watch the terminal for
errors.  I've encountered these types of errors in the past, although
intermittently.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Exception: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
<LI>SQLException: ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object
