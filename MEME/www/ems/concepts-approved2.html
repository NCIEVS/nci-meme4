<H1>Tracking Concepts Approved</H1>

This plot shows the number of concepts approved by day over the
past 'n' months.  Concepts are approved by editors either
manually using the interface
or by a batch process known as "stamping" run on behalf of the
editor who had responsibility for that worklist.
The plot can be selected for either or both types of approval.
<P>
Please don't place too much reliance on data prior to late March
1998 as MEME-II was still in its testing phase then.
