<H1>How to make the release</H1>

The distribution consists of two aggregate files: UMLS2000.ZIP and
UMLS2000.TGZ, the former for operating systems that use DOS style CR-LF
line termination (and Windows executables) and the latter for
UNIX-style line termination (LF) and Solaris and Linux executables.

<P>

The release files themselves are made at LTI.  In addition, they
should deliver the MetamorphoSys archives as in the files
MetamorphoSysWin.zip and MetamorphoSysUnix.zip after testing and
verifying that it works!  Once they have declared victory, NLM copies
the MR files into:

<PRE>

  wthsun:/d21/2000/MASTER/UMLS2000/META

</PRE>

Let /d21/2000 be TOP - change this to suit for the current release.
The full directory structure below TOP is:

<PRE>

  &lt;TOP&gt;/MASTER
    UMLS2000
      META
      METASUBSET
      NET
      DOC
      LEX

</PRE>
with other subdirectories beneath these.  Here are the steps in sequence:

<UL>

<LI>First, the master2dist.pl script makes some assumptions about which files
go on which CD.

  <UL>
  <LI>It assumes there are to be 2 CD's one containing the MRCXT file and
      the other the remaining files.

  <LI>Also that the final ZIP's are made on a PC and copied back over.
       To this end, it makes intermediate UM2000_[12].tgz files for copying to
       the PC and zipping (Bill does this).  Lately I've also made the ZIP using
       UNIX zip (in &lt;TOP&gt;/ZIP). But these do not go out on the CD until Bill
       is happy that it works on all platforms.
   <P>
    ***If any of these assumptions are no longer valid, you need to modify the
    code.
  </UL>

<P>

<LI>Timestamps on all files are set to the Jan 1st for that year, but this will
    change with every release.  This is unfortunately not parameterized in the
    script so modify the script to set the timestamp.

<P>

<LI>Ensure that LTI sets the permissions in the MetamorphoSys zip's correctly.
    The config directory contents should be group writeable.

<P>

<LI>Ensure that the versions of text files in TOP/MASTER have UNIX
    line termination.  Ensure that the DOC contents are current and
    up-to-date.

<P>

<LI>The MASTER/METASUBSET directory should be empty

<P>

<LI>Copy the latest (correct and verified) NET, LEX and DOC contents
    NET data comes from Alexa's group, LEX from Allen's and DOC from Laura.

<P>

<LI>Copy the MetamorphoSys zip's and the latest README.MMS into /d21/2000
    (test MetamorphoSys again if necessary!)

<P>

<LI>Ensure that the /d21/2000/UNIX and /d21/2000/ISO directories are present

<P>

<LI>Run the script /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl as the user 'wth':
<PRE>

    /site/umls/release/master2dist.pl -d /d21/2000 >& master2dist.log

</PRE>
    This took ~2 hrs to run for the 2000 release.  Once it has run, there
    should be contents in the UNIX, ISO, ZIP and TAR.

<P>

<LI>Verify that the ISO and UNIX contents are identical by running:

    /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u /d21/2000/UNIX/UMLS2000 -d /d21/2000/ISO/UMLS200 > md5.log

<P>

<LI>The &lt;TOP&gt;/TAR/UMLS2000.TAR/*.TGZ file gets mastered on the TAR CD.

<P>

<LI>The &lt;TOP&gt;/ZIP directory contains the tgz files which are FTP'ed to the PC,
    zip'ed and copied back into &lt;TOP&gt;/ZIP/UMLS2000.ZIP/*ZIP.

<P>

<LI>Ensure that these remade zip files have the timestamp and permission set correctly.

<P>

<LI>Master the CD's (Joe does this)

<P>

<LI>Compare the MD5 of the CD contents with that in &lt;TOP&gt;

<P>

<LI>Checking the CD's with md5_cmp.pl as:

<P>

<LI>unpack the TAR contents to say: /tmp/UNIX

<PRE>

    /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u /d21/2000/MASTER -d /tmp/UNIX -n

</PRE>

<P>

<LI>unpack the ISO contents to say: /tmp/ISO

<PRE>

    /site/umls/release/md5_cmp.pl -u /d21/2000/MASTER -d /tmp/ISO

</PRE>

<P>

<LI>If this checks out, test again!
