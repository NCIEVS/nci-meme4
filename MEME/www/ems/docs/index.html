<H1>Editing Management and Release FAQ - Overview</H1>

Between 1990 and 2000, the UMLS was produced in an annual cycle
usually in January after the editing was completed by November.
Since then, more frequent releases are anticipated; maybe upto four
a year.

<P>

The editing of the Metathesaurus takes place in the Metathesaurus
Information Database or MID which was in an Ingres database till 2000.
During that year the MID and all associated programs were ported to
Oracle.  The schema for the MID differs slightly from that used for
the release files.  The process of mapping one to the other is known
as "production".  Once the release files (the MR files) have been made
and checked by LTI/Apelon, NLM runs independent Q/A and scripts to
convert this to the form that will be pressed on the CD. Then the
editing cycle starts over again.

<P>

There are systems for source insertion and merging (LTI/Apelon), tools
to facilitate the editing: the editing interface (NLM) and tools to
generate the workload and manage the editing process: the EMS and WMS
(NLM).
