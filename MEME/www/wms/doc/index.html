<P>
<H1><A NAME="1">How to Make Checklists</A></H1>
You can make checklists in the EMS by following the action links in the
ME, QA or AH page.  But you can also make checklists from a
file of concept_ids, or optionally, concept_id|cluster_id pairs.
Simply use:

<PRE>

  /site/umls/oracle/wms-2.1/scripts/make-checklist.pl &lt; file

</PRE>

Optional arguments are:

<UL>
<LI> -c checklist name (default is chk_&lt;user&gt;)
<LI> -u who made this checklist (default is the UNIX login)
<LI> -d Oracle TNS (default is whatever current-editing-tns points to)
<LI> -m &lt;max&gt; maximum number of clusters in the checklist
<LI> -i Use this flag is the input consists of CUIs, not concept IDs.
	The CUIs are mapped to concept_ids from the concept_status table
	before the checklist is made.
</UL>

<P>

If the data is in a table, it first needs to be extracted to
UNIX.  I've written a script /site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl
that will do just this.  It takes two args:

<UL>
<LI> -t &lt;table name&gt;
<LI> -u &lt;user/schema name&gt;
</UL>

<P>

The -t is obvious.  Tables in Oracle are created in user namespaces
called schemas.  Our default schema is MTH.  To make a MTH table
visible to other users (e.g., meow), it has to have a public synonym.
If it doesn't (chances are one-off tables won't), use the -u option
to specify the schema.

<P>

So let's say LTI creates a table psy97_demotions in the MTH schema
with a single attribute that is a concept_id.  You can make a checklist
as follows:

<PRE>

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -t psy97_demotions -u MTH |
/site/umls/oracle/wms-2.0/scripts/make-checklist.pl
</pre>
<p>If the database being used is something other than the current_editing_tns,
the -d option needs to be used after each command.
<pre>

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -d oc_testsw -t VANDF01_replaced -u MTH 
| /site/umls/oracle/wms-2.0/scripts/make-checklist.pl -d oc_testsw -m 100

</PRE>

If the table contains other attributes and the concept_id is,
say, the third field, you need an intermediate awk to filter the
fields:

<PRE>

/site/umls/oracle/scripts/dump_table.pl -t psy97_demotions -u MTH |
nawk -F'|' '{print $3}' |
/site/umls/oracle/wms-2.0/scripts/make-checklist.pl

</PRE>

Easy ain't it?

<H1> <A NAME="2">How to make worklist/checklist reports</A> </H1>

A worklist or checklist <EM>report</EM> is a collection of concept reports for all
the individual concepts on a worklist or checklist in order.  Additionally, clusters
are identified with the cluster ID a concept's position in the cluster is noted
(e.g., #2 of 4).

<P>

In the WMS the link marked "Report" in the actions column is the way to make
reports for worklists and checklists.  This will bring up a form that will
also let you specify:

<P>

<UL>
<LI> When you want the report generator to run.  Your choices are the top of
	the hour for all the remaining hours left in the working day.  Since
	generating a report for a large worklist could take from 10 minutes to
	an hour, you have the option of starting this process later.
<P>
<LI> An email address for notifying you after your report has been made.
	This is optional since you can also check the "Report Queue" in the
	WMS for all the requests submitted to the report generator.  In this
	display, you can also cancel a pending request.
<P>
<LI> The type of report - stick to "Full" for now.
<P>
<LI> If you want certain lines in a report highlighted when it is printed,
	you can specify the pattern (case sensitive string only) here.
	The default display highlights only the first line of a concept
	report.
</UL>

<P>
Once a report has been generated the WMS records the path to the report
file either in the mail message to you or in the "Report Queue" listing.
This is the file that contains your report and can then be printed.

<H2>Making reports for Dead CUI worklists/checklists</H2>

This is an interim strategy for creating reports for deadcui worklists
and checklists.  On smis, run the script
<CODE>/site/umls/oracle/concept-reports/deadcui-report.pl</CODE> with
the -w option set to the worklist or checklist name:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
/site/umls/oracle/concept-reports/deadcui-report.pl -w chk_astra
/site/umls/oracle/concept-reports/deadcui-report.pl -w wrk03a_deadcui01_nc_01
</PRE>
</FONT>

The abbreviated reports is printed to the screen which can be stored in a file
or sent directly to the printer as in:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
/site/umls/oracle/concept-reports/deadcui-report.pl -w chk_astra > chk_astra.rpt
/site/umls/oracle/concept-reports/deadcui-report.pl -w wrk03a_deadcui01_nc_01 | enscript -rG
</PRE>
</FONT>

The editing-db database is used by default.  You can use the -d option to set
to another database (e.g., -d oc_testsrc).  Note that this report also needs
the MySQL databases from prior releases on umls-release.nlm.nih.gov to be available.

<P>

<A HREF="#top">&lt;Top&gt;</A>

<H1> <A NAME="3">How to print reports on a Postscript printer</A> </H1>

You have several ways to send a worklist or checklist report to the printer.
We use the program "enscript" to pretty print these reports in a format
that minimizes paper usage and yet is legible.

<P><FONT color=red>Note: UTF-8 printing added 3/2004</FONT>
<H2>Printing reports with extended (UTF-8) characters</H2>

The script: /site/umls/scripts/jenscript.pl is a Java implementation
of enscript that can handle UTF-8 characters.  Make sure that the report
is generated with HTML escapes to represent whitespace.

You need to specify the printer name (-p) and the report file name (-r)
as options to jenscript.pl.  Optionally you can have a different header
on every page by using the -b option.  The default header is the
name of the worklist or checklist as derived from the report's file name.

<P>
Options:
<PRE>
-r (path to report file) REQUIRED
-p (printer name, e.g., umlshp) REQUIRED
-b (alternative header)
</PRE>

<P>
Examples:
<PRE>

/site/umls/scripts/jenscript.pl -p umlshp -r chk_foo
/site/umls/scripts/jenscript.pl -p umlshp -r /d3/ems/reports/05a/wrk05a_missyn_01.rpt

</PRE>

<P>

<H2>Printing standard reports</H2>
A script in <CODE>/site/umls/scripts/print-report.pl</CODE> is probably
what you want if your report was generated in the WMS.  This script
automatically prints the descriptive information associated with the
worklist or checklist (if any) on the header of each page.  It also
is another chance for you to specify another highlight string, in addition
to the one you specified when you made the report in the WMS.

While it can print from standard output, the -r option should be used
to specify a report file where known.  The -h option is the highlight
option.  Here are some examples:

<PRE>

print-report.pl -r /d3/ems/reports/01b/wrk01b_mxsuppr_nc_01.965922282.rpt 
print-report.pl -r /d3/ems/reports/01b/wrk01b_mxsuppr_nc_01.965922282.rpt -h "PSY97"

</PRE>

You can also use enscript directly to print a worklist report.  Here is
an example:

<PRE>

enscript -b "Demotions" -2rG -f"Courier7" -e &lt; report.txt

</PRE>

The -e flag to enscript asks it to interpret escape sequences embedded
in the report file.  This is used by the WMS for highlighting.

<P>

You can use the highlighting script directly to highlight as many
strings as you want.  The script is in:
<CODE>/site/umls/scripts/enscript-highlight.pl</CODE>.
For example, to highlight all lines with the word
"ICD10AM" and "ICPC2E", and then send the result to the printer:

<PRE>

enscript-highlight.pl -s ATOMS -h "ICD10AM" &lt; chk_astra.rpt |
enscript-highlight.pl -s ATOMS -h "ICPC2E" &gt; chk_astra.rpt2
print-report.pl -r chk_astra.rpt2

</PRE>

<A HREF="#top">&lt;Top&gt;</A>

<H1> <A NAME="4">What is the Report Queue?</A> </H1>

In the WMS you can generate worklist and checklist reports by selecting
the "Report" action once you've found the worklists (or checklists)
you are interested in.  The request for a report is put in a FIFO
(first-in-first-out) queue to be processed one at a time by a report daemon.
The report daemon (in my cron) is constantly monitoring this queue for new requests.
Requests can be ACTIVE: if the time you want the report to be generated
is past, but the report daemon has not gotten to the request yet, PENDING:
you've asked the report to be generated at a later time, or CURRENT: 
the report is currently being generated.
<P>
The report daemon selects the earliest active request
and generates the report for it and optionally sends mail to the user
once it has completed.  All reports are archived in a standard location
and have standardized naming conventions.
<P>
The "Report Queue" action shows the status of pending and completed
requests.  You can "Cancel" PENDING requests (the report will
not be generated) and "Delete" completed requests (the request
is simply dequeued, never to be heard from again).
You cannot delete a CURRENT request.
