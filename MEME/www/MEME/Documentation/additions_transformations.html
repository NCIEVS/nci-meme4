representing NLM additions and transformations of original source

<h3>Problem</h3>
Simply put: user bewilderment!&nbsp; The real problem is that we
have too much baroque, user-hostile complexity in the use of
NLM-created "sources" and their relationships.&nbsp; Consider these
examples:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Providing an NLM interpretation of a source's
content.&nbsp; For example, a source hierarchy (e.g. MTHCH for CPT),
source entry terms (e.g. MTHICD9), or in some cases an entire source
(MTHFDA).&nbsp; The need for interpretation is often due to the lack of
availability of an electronic, machine-readable form of the source
content.&nbsp; In some cases, it may also be an NLM-specific
aggregation of source data to provide a useful view to users.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Providing transformations of&nbsp; UTF-8 non-ASCII characters in
atom names or attribute values where only the UTF-8 strings exist (e.g.
MTHSCT).</li>
  <li>Providing transformations of unusual syntax (e.g. MTHSCT).</li>
  <li>Providing American English equivalents to British English terms
(MDRAE, MTHICPC2ICD, etc.).</li>
  <li>Providing expansions of abbreviations (MDREX, MDREA).</li>
</ol>
In addition, the creation and maintenance of this undue complexity
is exponentially costly, and obscures and confounds process
verification and QA.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="requirements"></a>
<h3>Requirements for a Solution<br>
</h3>
<p>If we are to represent NLM augmentations and
extensions to source provided data, it needs to be done with a certain
set of requirements in mind.&nbsp; The solution should:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be easy for users to understand
and use</span>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attribute information
unambiguously to source or to NLM</span>
(i.e. source transparency). Creation of separate sources for most
transformations creates confusion.&nbsp; Attribution should be
achieved&nbsp; simply and transparently.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid providing all content in
7-bit ASCII forms</span>.&nbsp;
Instead, we should work toward requiring Unicode support for any user
needing to access all of the content.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to take
on complete transformation of all content into equivalent 7-bit
forms.&nbsp;
Specifically,</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Do not add the creation of 7-bit ASCII hierarchies to the
current model.</li>
    <li>Do not destroy (or add) any 7-bit transformations until we can
survey the user community to determine needs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note:&nbsp; </span>For
the time being, we will continue producing 7-bit transformation of
English language sources.&nbsp; One early
candidate for deletion is all 7-bit forms of Spanish, but first we need
to know whether we are serving a Spanish-speaking community without the
resources for Unicode support.&nbsp; Thus, removal of 7-bit
transformations of Spanish language sources will be subject to user
feedback.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minimize the use of
MetamorphoSys for data transformations</span>. MetamorphoSys should not
be overloaded because:</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>QA - these late transformations make QA tracking and integrity
and correctness of data difficult to verify as it flows from inversion
into users' hands.&nbsp; Every time we transform information, new code
must be written, errors can occur, and QA becomes maddeningly
complex.&nbsp; We already have too many transformations as it is.&nbsp;
Adding further transformations of source attributed data is a recipe
for disaster</li>
    <li>The MetamorphoSys computing environment makes very clever use
of small machines, and runs very well on multiple platforms.&nbsp; We
should precompute useful information and not add to clients' processing
time and to the system hardware and software requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wherever possible, avoid leaving
gaps or
holes in a source</span>.&nbsp;
Transformations should be offered as useful pathways into source data,
and not as alternatives to the use of source information itself.&nbsp;
In our long-term vision, an original source atom that participates in a
hierarchy should
not be eschewed in favor of an easier-to-read one that does not
participate in the source hierarchy.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Note</span>:&nbsp;
in the interim period, while we continue producing 7-bit
transformations of English language atoms, the "Remove UTF-8" button
will remain in MetamorphoSys, and selection of this option will lead to
output that contains gaps in the hierarchies for certain sources.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be
general enough to create transformations or additions of any kind of
core content</span>.&nbsp; This solution should clearly and
consistently apply to atoms, relationships,
and attributes so as to meet current and future needs.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be able to precisely correlate
the transformed or added data with the original</span>.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<a name="solution"></a>
<h3>Action</h3>
<p>We recommend the following proposed solution.<br>
<br>
The issues break down
into two broad categories:<br>
</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Transformations of existing source data, where original source
data also appears.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Addition of data (usually atoms), possibly derived from
non-machine-readable original source data, where original source data
does NOT also appear.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
</ol>
1. In cases where we are adding or
augmenting source content (MTHICD9, MTHCH, and MTHHH), we will continue
with the MTH&lt;sab&gt; approach.&nbsp; This involves:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a source whose SAB is MTH&lt;SAB&gt; to indicate that it
is an MTH addition to the &lt;SAB&gt; source.&nbsp; This will be a
fully-fledged source, with SRC concepts and a MRSAB entry.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The source family of the MTH&lt;SAB&gt; will match the source
family of the original source; this will allow MetamorphoSys to keep
them tightly bound.</li>
</ul>
2. In cases where we are transforming source data for any reason
(including: formatting, ease of use, Americanizations, and expansions
of abbreviations) we will use the following approach:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The SAB of the transformed source data element will remain the
same (e.g. SNOMEDCT, not MTHSCT).<br>
  </li>
  <li>For transformed atoms, the prefix MTH_ will be prepended to the
TTY value of the atom being transformed (e.g. MTH_FN instead of FN).</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The CODE of the MTH_ atom should match that of the original atom</li>
    <li>The SCUI of the MTH_ atom should match that of the original atom</li>
    <li>The SDUI of the MTH_ atom should match that of the original atom</li>
    <li>The SAUI should be null.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>For transformed attributes, the prefix MTH_ will be prepended to
the ATN value of the attribute being transformed (e.g. MTH_SOS instead
of SOS).</li>
  <li>Where
possible, an explicit relationship will be created to more closely bind
the transformed data element to the original.&nbsp;
Specifically, transformed atoms will be connected via SFO/LFO
relationships (to be released as SY) whose RELA will indicate the
nature of the transformation.&nbsp; This RELA value will also be
prepended with the mth_ prefix (e.g. mth_plain_text_form_of).&nbsp; In
this way, attribution of this data to the Metathesaurus will be
clear to users, as the SAB will match that of the original
source.&nbsp; This notation can also be extended to denote other types
of transformed relationships if future needs arise. Finally, as future
needs dictate, attributes for transformed
relationships and attributes themselves can be added to link them to
the original source data. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Implementing this solution will require forward-looking and
backward-looking approaches.&nbsp; For sources that have predictable
update cycles (like SNOMEDCT, SCTSPA) the next update of these sources
will implement transformations/additions according to the
specification, thus phasing out the use of MTH&lt;SAB&gt; sources and
7-bit transformations. Limited transformations to meet expressed user
needs can always be considered for MetamorphoSys development. For
historical sources, that are not
expected to be updated (e.g. RCDAE_1999), we will compile all of the
changes that need to be made and make them all at once (for just these
sources), at some convenient time.<br>
<br>
<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Examples and Data<br>
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>We have sources like MTHCH and MTHHH which provide
NLM-created and maintained hierarchies for sources CPT and HCPCS,
respectively.&nbsp; The sources do not have hierarchies available in
electronic, machine-readable form, and so to make the content more
usable, MTH
versions of these hierarchies are maintained.&nbsp; For sources like
MTHICD9, entry terms in ICD9 were not available in an electronic,
machine-readable form, and so they were processed and edited by NLM
into a more usable form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, for a source like MTHFDA,
there was an available electronic database containing source data, but
a particular NLM interpretation of this data was used instead.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MTHSCT that provide transformations of UTF-8
characters into 7-bit ASCII.&nbsp; Consider the following
example.&nbsp; First, here is an original SNOMEDCT term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">90525579|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31/SY|10651001|N|Y|N|KlÃ¼ver-Bucy
syndrome|N|18506014|10651001||ENG|1727773|</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Here is the corresponding MTHSCT term, note the lack of Ã¼:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91499848|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/SY|10651001|R|Y|N|Kluver-Bucy
syndrome|N|18506014|||ENG|1727774|</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
This type of transformation will also be needed in the future for
sources that have UTF-8 non-ASCII attribute values.&nbsp; For example,
MeSH and LOINC.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MTHSCT that provide
transformations of SNOMEDCT-specific representations of sub and
super-scripts.&nbsp; Consider the
following example.&nbsp; First, here is an original SNOMEDCT term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91485165|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|N|Y|N|Blood
group antibody B&gt;w&lt;|Y|128263017|77279000||ENG|1073034|</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Here are the MTHSCT transformations of this term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91507742|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|R|Y|N|Blood
group antibody B w|Y|128263017S|||ENG|1073036|</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91507743|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|R|Y|N|Blood
group antibody
B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;|Y|128263017X|||ENG|1073037|NG|1073039|</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Where SNOMEDCT offers the use of '&gt;w&lt;' to indicate a subscripted
'w', we offer for variants that may be more useful for users.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MDRAE and MTHICPC2ICD10AE that provide
Americanizations of otherwise British English terms.&nbsp; NLM uses a
particular algorithm to perform the transliteration that may not be
explicitly supported by the source provider, and so we do not want to
attribute the Americanization to the source provider.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MDREX and MDREA that provide expansions of
abbreviations that are not explicitly asserted by the source.</li>
