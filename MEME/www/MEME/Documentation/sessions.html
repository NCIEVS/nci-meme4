<h2>MEME Sessions</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
 The MEME application server supports session enabled access. &nbsp;A session 
is a server side object which handles resources (such as a database connection) 
which clients may want to reuse upon subsequent requests. <br>
   <br>
 Sessions are represented on the server side by the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
object. &nbsp;It is an extended HashMap which supports the tracking of additional 
resources such as the current request and the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/sql/MEMEDataSource.html">MEMEDataSource</a> 
connection. &nbsp;<br>
   
  <h3>Session Enabled Requests<br>
   </h3>
 The life-cycle of a session begins when a client requests that the server 
initiate a session. &nbsp;From the client's perspective, this is done by calling
the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/ClientAPI.html#initiateSession%28%29">ClientAPI.initiateSession()</a> 
method. &nbsp;This causes the server to generate a session id and a <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
object. &nbsp;The object is hashed using the session identifier for future 
access. &nbsp;Each time a future client request enters the server with a request
containing the session id, the server looks up the relevant SessionContext 
object and passes it to the appropriate request handler. &nbsp;This allows 
a session to open a database connection and keep it open across requests. 
&nbsp;<br>
   <br>
 The life-cycle of a session ends when a client either explicitly terminates 
a session by making a call to <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/ClientAPI.html#terminateSession%28%29">ClientAPI.terminateSession()</a> 
or when a session times out. &nbsp;If an application does not explicitly set
the session timeout (via <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/ClientAPI.html#setTimeout%28long%29">ClientAPI.setTimeout(long)</a>) 
the default value of 1 hour will be used. &nbsp;The server employs a thread 
called <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionTimeoutThread.html">SessionTimeoutThread</a> 
to terminate active sessions which have not handled any requests during the 
timeout period. &nbsp;A session is said to have expired if it was terminated 
by the&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionTimeoutThread.html">SessionTimeoutThread</a>.<br>
   <br>
  Session management is largely transparent from an application developer's
 perspective. &nbsp;Should an application want to use session enabled requests,
 it should call initiateSession() on the client it is using, and all future
 requests will be session enabled. &nbsp;Should an application not want to 
use sessions, no additional effort is required. &nbsp;Some clients, such as
  <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/EditingClient.html">EditingClient</a>
 automatically initiate sessions, thus preventing the application from having
 to make any explicit calls.<br>
   <br>
 Here are some important points about session enabled requests:<br>
   
  <ol>
     <li>When requests use a data source and are session enabled, the data 
source objects should be kept in the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
object and only returned to the pool or closed when the session terminates 
or the data source changes.</li>
     <li>If a&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
using a "default" data source is terminated, the data source is returned to
the pool.</li>
     <li>If a&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
using a non-default data source is terminated, the data source is closed.</li>
     <li>If a subsequent session enabled request uses a different data source 
than the&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
is tracking, that data source is returned to the pool if it is a default data
source, otherwise it is closed.</li>
     <li>If a request attempts to use a session that has been terminated
(or has expired), an <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/exception/ExpiredSessionException.html">ExpiredSessionException</a> 
is thrown.<br>
     </li>
   
  </ol>
   
  <h3>Sessionless Requests<br>
   </h3>
 Clients can also make requests in a "no session" mode (by setting the session 
id in the request to null). No session requests also generate <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/SessionContext.html">SessionContext</a> 
objects but they are essentially single use objects which are not tracked 
and all of whose resources are returned or closed when the request finishes 
processing. &nbsp;Generally, if a client does not want to use sessions, it 
should simply not call the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/ClientAPI.html#initiateSession%28%29">ClientAPI.initiateSession()</a> 
method. &nbsp;<br>
