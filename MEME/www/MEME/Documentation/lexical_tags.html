<h2>LT TRD - Trade Name Lexical Tag Semantics<br>
</h2>
  </center>




      
<hr>&nbsp;<br>




   
<h3>Overview</h3>




   
<blockquote>As of 2004AB, the only lexical tag (LT) attributes released
in the Metathesaurus are TRD, or trade name. There are two important
issues with respect to semantics that need&nbsp; to be explored and
refined:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>1. At what level do TRD lexical tags exist?&nbsp; Is it AUI, SUI, or CUI?</li>
    <li>How should editors approach the task of assigning TRD lexical
tags?&nbsp; Related to this is the issue of how this information
appears in concept reports and in the editor<br>

  

       
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul>

<h3>Release Semantics<br>
</h3>



<blockquote>
  <div>The current state of lexical tag semantics can be summarized by the following email from Bill Hole (<a href="mailto:wth@nlm.nih.gov">wth@nlm.nih.gov</a>) (Subject: Re: Proposal:&nbsp; Future of LT attributes, Date: 06/23/2004).<br>
  <br>
  <pre>LTs are actually atom properties, and can never be CUI properties! 
  </pre>
  </div>

  <div>
  <pre>Think "Kleenex" the brand name vs "Kleenex" the generic name <br>(the company blew the process of claiming the rights) to explain <br>the Atomic nature of a trademark, or all the drug names which are <br>in the same CUI with generic names where only the trademarked <br>AUIs are LT=TRD. An LT is NOT a LUI property, either; singular/plural <br>and case variation are specific attributes of a trademarked name. <br><br>We currently only send out TRD LTs, though there are more LTs in <br>MeSH and the MID.<br><br>The only snag came in when editors correctly argued that they <br>NEVER want to assign LTs laboriously to every atom, when there <br>are many instances of several atoms sharing a SUI which all have <br>the same LT. At that point, we decided that IN THE MID <br>1- ANY atom assigned an LT triggers propagation of that LT <br>to ALL SUI members WITHIN that CUI <br>2- Editors need to be able to remove the LT from an atom <br>in the rare case like "Kleenex". <br>(I can't recall whether this was actually implemented; <br>it's another case like Editor Suppressibilty where the <br>editor-assigned non-LT status is rare and must always win).</pre>
  </div>







  <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>










  <div>It is also important to mention that RXNORM has its own notion
of TRD semantics which imply that a concept is either a "generic" drug
(or medical device) or it is a "branded" drug (or device).&nbsp; In
this way, RXNORM sees TRD lexical tags as attributes of a concept, and
not of of particular strings.<br>
  <br>
It is also important to mention that past Metathesaurus semantics
caused LT TRD attributes to be assigned at the LUI level.&nbsp; This
was problematic for a variety of reasons and this should never be done
again.<br>
  <br>
Finally TRD LT attributes are released in MRSAT as connected to AUI
values with an STYPE of AUI.&nbsp; However, when an LT attribute exists
in the attirbutes table, it is exanded to be connected to <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span> AUI sharing that SUI value.<br>
  </div>
</blockquote><h3>Editing Semantics<br>
</h3>

<blockquote>Editors should have a shorthand way of assigning TRD
lexical tags so as to not have to attach one to every atom in a concept
that is a trade name.&nbsp; Currently, editors are trained to assume
that a TRD lexical tag will apply to the entire concept.&nbsp; Given
that TRD release semantics indicate assignment at the SUI level, this incongruity needs to be resolved.<br>
