<h3>Problem</h3>

For consistency and usability, there are occasional
needs to provide additional NLM-created data that is tightly coupled
with native source data.&nbsp; In such cases, it is important for users
to understand that NLM has augmented source data, so as to avoid
mis-attributing source information.&nbsp; Some common reasons for doing
this include:<br>


<ol>


  <li>Providing an NLM interpretation of a source
content.&nbsp; For example, a source hierarchy (e.g. MTHCH for CPT),
source entry terms (e.g. MTHICD9), or in some cases an entire source
(MTHFDA).&nbsp; The need for interpretation is often due to the lack of
availability of an electronic, machine-readable form of the source
content.&nbsp; In some cases, it may also be an NLM-specific aggregation of source data to provide a useful view to users.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Providing transformations of&nbsp; UTF-8 non-ASCII characters in
atom names or attribute values where only the UTF-8 strings exist (e.g.
MTHSCT).</li>
  <li>Providing transformations of unusual syntax. (e.g. MTHSCT)</li><li>Providing American English equivalents to British English terms (MDRAE, MTHICPC2ICD...)</li><li>Providing expansions of abbreviations (MDREX, MDREA)<br>
  </li>

</ol>


<br>


<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<ol>

  <li>1. We have sources like MTHCH and MTHHH which provide
NLM-created and maintained hierarchies for sources CPT and HCPCS,
respectively.&nbsp; The sources do not have hierarchies available in
electronic, machine-readable form, and so to make the content more
usable, MTH
versions of these hierarchies are maintained.&nbsp; For sources like
MTHICD9, entry terms in ICD9 were not available in an electronic,
machine-readable form, and so they were processed and edited by NLM
into a more usable form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, for a source like MTHFDA,
there was an available electronic database containing source data, but
a particular NLM interpretation of this data was used instead.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>

We have sources like MTHSCT that provide transformations of UTF-8
characters into 7-bit ASCII.&nbsp; Consider the following
example.&nbsp; First, here is an original SNOMEDCT term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">90525579|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31/SY|10651001|N|Y|N|Kl&Atilde;&frac14;ver-Bucy
syndrome|N|18506014|10651001||ENG|1727773|</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Here is the corresponding MTHSCT term, note the lack of &Atilde;&frac14;:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91499848|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/SY|10651001|R|Y|N|Kluver-Bucy syndrome|N|18506014|||ENG|1727774|</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
This type of transformation will also be needed in the future for
sources that have UTF-8 non-ASCII attribute values.&nbsp; For example,
MeSH and LOINC.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MTHSCT that provide
transformations of SNOMEDCT-specific representations of sub and super-scripts.&nbsp; Consider the
following example.&nbsp; First, here is an original SNOMEDCT term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91485165|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31|SNOMEDCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|N|Y|N|Blood
group antibody B&gt;w&lt;|Y|128263017|77279000||ENG|1073034|</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Here are the MTHSCT transformations of this term:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91507742|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|R|Y|N|Blood group antibody B w|Y|128263017S|||ENG|1073036|</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">91507743|MTHSCT_2005_07_31|MTHSCT_2005_07_31/OP|77279000|R|Y|N|Blood
group antibody B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;|Y|128263017X|||ENG|1073037|NG|1073039|</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
Where SNOMEDCT offers the use of '&gt;w&lt;' to indicate a subscripted
'w', we offer for variants that may be more useful for users.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>

We have sources like MDRAE and MTHICPC2ICD10AE that provide
Americanizations of otherwise British English terms.&nbsp; NLM uses a
particular algorithm to perform the transliteration that may not be
explicitly supported by the source provider, and so we do not want to
attribute the Americanization to the source provider.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We have sources like MDREX and MDREA that provide expansions of abbreviations that are not explicitly asserted by the source.</li>
</ol>



<a name="requirements"></a>
<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>If we are to represent NLM augmentations and
extensions to source provided data, it needs to be done with a certain
set of requirements in mind.&nbsp; Here is a start at defining these
requirements:<br>
</p>


<ol>


  <li>Easy for users to make use of (i.e. clean integration with MMSYS)</li>
  <li>Where at all possible, a solution should avoid leaving gaps or
holes in a source.&nbsp; For example, if we remove UTF-8 SNOMEDCT
atoms, the contexts also get removed.&nbsp; A perfect solution would
not allow this kind of loss of data for a usability enhancement.</li>
  <li>Clear attribution of source data.&nbsp; It should be very clear
to users that transformations of or additions to source-provided data
are the responsibility of the NLM, and not of the original source
provider.</li>
  <li>Ability to create transformations or additions of any kind of core content (atoms, attributes, contexts, relationships).</li>
  <li>Ability to precisely correlate the transformed or added data with the original<br>
  </li>
</ol>




Ideally all requirements should be met, but we may find it difficult to satisfy all of them without significant code-rewriting.<br>


<br>


<a name="current"></a>
<h3>Current Solution</h3>

<p>The current solution to the problem is to
create a heavyweight source whose SAB begins with "MTH" and ends with
something closely resembling the original SAB (subjected to length,
style conventions).&nbsp; Also, the "source family" of this MTH source
must match the original source family.&nbsp; Thus far, this solution
has only been applied in the case of transformed or additional atoms,
and has not yet been used for attributes, context relationships, or
normal relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a transformed atom is created, a
relationship is also created whose rela specifies its relationship to
the original atom that it transforms.<br>
</p>


<p>This solution addresses the requirements in the following ways.&nbsp; <br>
</p>


<ol>


  <li>Integration with MMSYS is done via the "source family"
mechanism.&nbsp; If a user selects SNOMEDCT, they are encouraged to
also select MTHSCT.</li>
  <li>The "leave-no-content-behind" requirement is not met by this solution</li>
  <li>There is clear attribution in the sense that all transformed or added content is clearly marked with its own SAB.</li>
  <li>This solution would work for all data types.&nbsp; For
transformation of context relationships, however, it would require a
complete copy of the original source contexts..</li>
  <li>Correlation with original data is accomplished by the use of
relationships attributed to this new source.&nbsp; The RELA specifies
the type of transformation.</li>
</ol>


The main drawback of this solution is that a whole source is a very
heavyweight thing in the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; It interacts with most of
the QA infrastructure, and involves the management of additional SRC
concepts and MRSAB entries.&nbsp; This is a lot of extra work to go to
in the case of a source like LOINC or PNDS that has only a few cases of
atoms that would require transformations.&nbsp; Suppose we had a source
X that had a single UTF-8 non-ASCII attribute.&nbsp; Would we be
willing to create an entire MTHX source to represent just that single
attribute?&nbsp; Whatever solution we choose should accommodate all
cases, including the case of a single source element that would benefit
from transformation, or the addition of a single piece of information
that would make the source more usable.<br>


<br>


<a name="proposed"></a>
<h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>

Before discussing various solutions, it is
worth noting that the examples and cases described above break down
into two broad categories:<br>


<ol>


  <li>Transformations of existing source data, where original source data also appears<br>
</li>
  <li>Addition of data (usually atoms), possibly derived from
non-machine-readable original source data, where original source data
does NOT also appear.<br>
  </li>
</ol>


It may be worth considering separate solutions for these two
classes.&nbsp; In particular, in most cases where we are adding or
augmenting source content (MTHICD9, MTHCH, and MTHHH), it is
appropriate to create an entire new source for this purpose, and to
share the source family.&nbsp; This is a case where the drawbacks of
the current solution are not evident, because: (a) the addition is
usually sufficiently large to warrant the heavyweight solution of
adding a new source (e.g hundreds/thousands of new atoms), and (b) the
correlation requirement is not relevant.&nbsp; In a sense, the addition
IS a new source, one that either hangs off of another source, or
provides structure for a source.<br>


<br>


With that in mind, here are five proposals for alternatives to the way
we currently handle the first class of changes, data
transformations.&nbsp; Most solutions attempt to address the problem by
marking the content in new (and less heavyweight) ways that can be well
documented so as to make attribution of transformations explicit to
users.<br>


<br>


<ol>


  <li>As suggested first by MSE, we could prepend certain fields with a
code that indicated that this data was transformed by NLM.&nbsp; For
example, we could use TTY for atoms, ATN for attributes, and RELA for
contexts or relationships.&nbsp; So instead of having a MTHSCT/FN, we
could have a SNOMEDCT/MTH_FN.&nbsp; It would be clear that this was the
MTH-ized form of the original SNOMEDCT/FN atom.&nbsp; A relationship
between the two could make it even more explicit.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Use a content view.&nbsp; While this is a departure from the
normal sense of a content view, one of the bits in the field could be
used to explicitly mark MTH data.&nbsp; As in other solutions, relationships can
be used to make the type of connection more explicit.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Rather than transforming fields like SAB, TTY, ATN, RELA, or CVF,
we could attach attributes to all transformed data indicating that it
is an MTH transformation of the original data.&nbsp; We could even use
a value to indicate the UI of the original source information, thus
preventing the need for explicit relationships.&nbsp; For example, we
could have MTH_TRANSFORM_7_BIT as the ATN and an AUI or SAUI value as
the value indicating that this atom transforms that other particular
source atom.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>We could enact an MMSYS-only solution.&nbsp; That is, have an
output stream option to perform the data transformation as a subsetting
operation.&nbsp; In effect, there would be no explicit UMLS data to
represent the transformations.&nbsp; Instead, at the users request, the
actual data would be transformed as a subsetting function.&nbsp; That
way the user could take responsibility for transforming the data rather
than NLM explicitly doing it.&nbsp; For example, there could be an
option to create 7-bit forms of all UTF-8 non-ASCII data.&nbsp; Rather
than implementing it by removing the original SNOMEDCT atom and using
an MTHSCT one, instead the UTF-8 STR value for a particular SNOMEDCT
atom would be transliterated by LVG tools in the background and the
same atom, with a different string would appear in the
output.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
This solution could be paired with one of the others too, so that
rather than calculating transformations on the fly, we could have the
pre-transformed data exist in the background, and use it only where
selected by users.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
This solution has the nice feature that we can essentially in-line the
transformations upon the users request, which can satisfy the
"leave-no-content-behind" requirement.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Stop performing transformations.&nbsp; The original inspiration
for these transformations was to make 7-bit ASCII representations of
UTF-8 characters available to users who cannot handle them.&nbsp; Given
the wide availability of tools (databases, etc) that can properly
handle character sets like UTF-8, maybe it is time to stop this
practice and encourage users to embrace UTF-8.&nbsp; This is
particularly true because uses of a source like SNOMEDCT, who do not
obtain it from UMLS, are expected to handle the UTF-8 content properly.<br>
  </li>
</ol>


<a name="simplify"></a>
<h3>Simplifying the Solution</h3>

Our hope is to avoid over-complicating the situation and arriving at a
solution that while comprehensive and generic may be too complex for
general users to understand or make good use of.&nbsp; Consider the
following two limitations on the requirements:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Phase out the creation of 7-bit transformations.&nbsp; First, get
rid of all cases where we generate them for sources that are not
expected to be updated, then phase them out for all other sources as
they are updated.</li>
  <li>Only create NLM transformations of atoms.&nbsp; Do not create transformations of attributes or relationships.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

The second follows from the first.&nbsp; At present, the only need to
create transformed attributes is to represent 7-bit forms of 8-bit
attribute values.&nbsp; There is no current need to represent NLM
transformations of relationships (and no forseeable need).&nbsp; By
placing these two restrictions on the requirements, we can arrive at a
much simpler and more elegant proposal, that users in general can
expect to understand and make quick use of.&nbsp; Consider this
proposal:<br>

<ol>

  <li>For NLM additions to sources (e.g. MTHCH), keep the current
solution.&nbsp; These are appropriate cases for the use of the
heavyweight "new source" solution.</li>
  <li>Phase out the use of 7-bit transformations</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Remove all 7-bit transformations for sources that will not be updated</li>
    <li>As other sources are update, do not inver 7-bit transformations</li>
    <li>Inform users now, elicit feedback</li>
    <li>Provide information on how users can use LVG to perform these transformations themselves<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Limit transformations to atoms only.&nbsp; Transform for these reasons only:</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Transformations of strange syntax (e.g.sub/superscripts)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Americanizations</li>
    <li>Expansions of short or abbreviated forms</li>
    <li>Expansions to fully specified names, where fully specified names are not directly available<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Mark transformed atoms with same SAB, and source UIs as the
original.&nbsp; Indicate MTH-ness with use of an "MTH_" prefix to the
TTY.&nbsp; Thus an MTH_FN will be a "MTH Trasnformed Fully Specified
Name"</li>
  <li>Connect MTH transformed atoms to their original source
counterparts with an SFO/LFO/ relationship (owned by MTH) whose RELA
specifies the reason for transformation (e.g. "americanization_of")</li><li>Transformed
atoms will not participate in contexts, but non-transformed atoms will
no longer be removed by MMSYS, so there will be no holes in the
contexts.<br>
  </li>

</ol>

To see how this solution will be applied, let's look at all current cases:<br>
