<font size=+0>Source Editing in the <i>MID</i></font></h2></center>

<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Introduction</b></td>

<td NOSAVE><font size=-1>The <i>MEME</i> and the <i>MID</i> exist primarily
as an environment for Metathesaurus editors to perform the editing operations
necessary to integrate the constituent sources into the <i>Metathesaurus
concept structure</i>.&nbsp; It is highly desirable to extend this functionality
to allow editors of individual sources to maintain their content within
the same system, allowing <i>source creation</i> and <i>source integration</i>
to happen simultaneously with all of the advantages and rigor that the
<i>MEME
action model</i> affords.</font></td>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Editing</b>
<br><b>Requirements</b></td>

<td><font size=-1>A source creation system in the <i>MID</i> would require
(at least) the following functionality:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size=-1>Management of a source level view of conceptness (orthogonal
to CUIs).&nbsp; This should support the ability to create concepts, add
atoms to concepts, merge concepts, move atoms from one concept to another,
or split atoms out of a concept to create new concepts.&nbsp; Assertions
of <i>synonymy</i> are made by either adding or moving atoms to an existing
concept that contains other atoms..</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Ability to assert relationships and relationship attributes.&nbsp;
These assertions should allowed between source concepts within the same
source, source atoms within the same source, or source concepts from one
source to source concepts from another source (that presumably was also
edited in this system).&nbsp; Code to code relationships should <i>not</i>
be permitted.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Ability to connect attributes to source atoms or to source
concepts.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Ability to edit hierarchies (contexts).&nbsp; A <i>context</i>
for an atom is considered to be either just the path to the root, or the
path to the root plus a relationship attribute (like in UWDA, indicating
the tree that this context appears in).&nbsp; The system must allow either
of these approaches to be used.&nbsp; Editing of hierarchies will be done
in a top-down fashion where parent-child relationships will be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For poly-hierarchies, an editor will not only have to choose a parent,
but choose a complete path to the root (as the parent may have different
paths to the root).</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Ability to edit meta data to control values for things like
termgroups, attribute names, attribute values, relationship names, etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>There should be no semantics to the values used for the source
concept identifiers.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>An orthogonal notion of status will be required.&nbsp; Currently,
editing at the Metathesaurus level is managed by a status field in each
of the core tables.&nbsp; Here, we will require an additional source-specific
status field.&nbsp; There should be at least four values for this field.</font></li>

<ol>
<li>
<font size=-1><i>In Progress</i>.&nbsp; This is used to mark source content
that is in the process of being edited and should not be seen by anyone
except editors of this particular source.&nbsp; This kind of data is not
subjected to validation.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Provisionally Approved</i>.&nbsp; This is used to mark
content that has been <i>approved</i> by editors but which has not yet
been validated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any validation performed should include data
marked this way.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Approved (for MID editing)</i>.&nbsp; Content with this
status has been edited by source editors and has passed validation checks
and should be visible to <i>MID</i> editors.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Approved (for source release)</i>.&nbsp; This status is
reserved for a source that has been completely edited and validated and
is ready for release.&nbsp; This content should also be visible to <i>MID</i>
editors.</font></li>
</ol>

<li>
<font size=-1>An orthogonal notion of releasability will be required.&nbsp;
As with Metathesaurus editing, there is lots of content that is not useful
to release, but is useful to have for editing purposes (for example, the
various <i>note</i> attributes).</font></li>
</ol>
</td>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Validation</b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><font size=-1>Each source edited in the <i>MID</i>
should have its own source-specific validation suite.&nbsp; The <a href="/cgi-lti-oracle/validate_mid.cgi">MID
Validation</a> system may be extended to support this task.&nbsp; There
are certain standard checks that we will probably want to perform on all
sources, including:&nbsp;</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size=-1>Spell checking of atoms and attribute values.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>No orphan check.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Referential Integrity.&nbsp; Generally, all content connected
to atom/concept identifiers must use valid identifiers.&nbsp; This presents
a problem with respect to the various status levels.&nbsp; Suppose you
have a check that requires that a concept cannot become approved until
all of its relationships point to approved concepts.&nbsp; If you have
two concepts, neither of which are approved, that are related to each other
then you will be unable to approve either one because each will point to
an unapproved concept.</font></li>
</ol>
<font size=-1>There should be real time validation checks that take place
during editing, as well as bulk validation scripts that run database wide
and validate the entire source.&nbsp; To get around the referential integrity
check problem we should have different sets of checks for content that
is moving from <i>In Progress</i> to <i>Provisionally Approved</i> then
we have for content moving from <i>Provisionally Approved</i> to <i>Approved</i>.&nbsp;
Additionally, there should be checks that take place after approval (like
Matrix initializer) that can unapprove content that does not satisfy the
final checks.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Finally, there should be some generic <i>metadata validation</i>
that normalizes things like attribute names and values, termgroups, and
relationship attributes.&nbsp; This can also include a generic mechanism
for expressing rules such as one that would make termgroups representing
abbreviations unreleasable.</font></td>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Schema&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Changes</b></td>

<td><font size=-1>Implementation of the editing requirements and validation
suites will require some small changes to the existing <i>MID</i> schema.&nbsp;
In particular, core data tables will need to track the source editing fields,
including source concept identifiers, the source-editing notion of status,
the source-editing notion of releasability, possibly additional timestamp
fields, action tables for source actions, and a table for tracking meta
data for source editing.</font></td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Versions</b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><font size=-1>Source editors will be editing a source
within the <i>MID</i> at the same time that Metathesaurus editors are editing
the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; Because this is true, one thing that becomes very
important is the visibility of source level information to Metathesaurus
editors.&nbsp; In the past, the year starts with one complete version of
each source present in the database.&nbsp; A source update introduces a
second complete version of a source into the database.&nbsp; With this
system, we will have a complete old version of a source along with a <i>partial</i>
new version of a source.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>In order to prevent a conflict, we will have to keep <i>partially</i>
edited content invisible to MTH editors while it the source is being edited.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the source is completely edited, some operation should be performed
that makes the entire source visible to MTH editors as a new version of
the source.&nbsp; As in the past, while MTH editors edit an updated source,
the immediately previous version should remain visible to these editors.</font></td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Insertions</b></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><font size=-1>Our existing notion of a source involves
taking files from some external organization, processing those files into
a standard file format (inversion), and then bulk loading the data into
the <i>MID</i> while no editors are active.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data loaded is
the matched to existing <i>MID</i> content in order to facilitate the aggregation
of new data into the existing concept structure.&nbsp; For sources that
are edited within the <i>MID</i>, we will have to refine our notion of
an insertion.&nbsp; It will most likely involve an operation that "turns
on" an entire new version of a source, meaning that it makes it visible
to Metathesaurus editors, then we will likely perform the same matching
and post merging steps that we do now, although the safe-replacement algorithm
will be much more obvious as it will be determined by the source editors.</font></td>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b>Implementation</b>
<br><b>Goals</b></td>

<td><font size=-1>In the short term, the main goal is to refine some of
these notions and test them out through the implementation of an editor
kit for the <i>Semantic Normal Form</i> atoms.&nbsp; This tool will be
used to edit existing&nbsp;</font>
<br><font size=-1>SNF-CD atoms as well as add new ones.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In the longer term, this is really a matter of extending
the MEME database schema to accommodate additional concept_id and editing
fields as well as additional action tables for <i>source actions</i>, and
then implementing an MEME4 API (back end) for performing the editing operations,
and finally implementing an interface (front end) for the actual work involved.</font></td>
