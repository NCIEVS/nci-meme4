<ul><li>First, we look up all of the "suspect concepts".&nbsp; These
are concepts that involve either split or merged CUIs (or both).&nbsp;
We get a <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span> list by extracting all <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">last_release_cui</span> and all <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">last_assigned_cui </span>from classes (where they are not null).&nbsp; We then find cases of &gt;1 <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span> per <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span> and &gt;1 <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span> per <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span>.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Next we look up all of the "suspect atoms".&nbsp; These are atoms in suspect concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Then, we rank <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span> mappings (derived from the suspect atoms).&nbsp; Mappings involving <span style="font-family: monospace;">last_release_cui</span> will outrank mappings involving <span style="font-family: monospace;">last_assigned_cui</span> when from the same atom.&nbsp; We find the highest rank for each <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span> pair.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Now, we iterate through all of the candidate assignments, starting with the highest ranking one.&nbsp; The first <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span>
is added to the list of assignments.&nbsp; All candidate assignments with a matching
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_id</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace;">cui</span> are removed.</li>
          <li>We repeat the previous step until no candidate assignments remain on the list.</li>
          <li>We then identify 1-1 cases (where globally across the
databases splits and merges did not occur), and add those assignments
to the list of assignments.<br>
          </li>
          <li>We then identify concepts that do not have assignments and assign "new" CUI
values for those concepts that did not receive assignments and still contain releasable atoms.&nbsp; The prefix
