<h2><center>Single Environment Specification (06/27/2005)</center></h2>

<hr width="100%">
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>MEME and related software depend heavily on the proper configuration
of the surrounding environment.&nbsp; An attempt has been made to make
as much code as
possible run in an environment relative to one or more environment
variables (such as $MEME_HOME or $EMS_HOME).&nbsp; Different parts of
the system operate in very different execution environments (shell
scripts, perl scripts, scrips called via java's Runtime.exec, java
components, CGI applications, webapps, etc) and the means for
configuring the surrounding environment variables is different in each
place.<br>
</p>
<p>This document outlines a toolkit for supporting configuration of
environment variables in all executing environments from a single
place.&nbsp; In other words, a file in a given installation could be
used to contain all environment information and the toolkit could be
used by any of the execution environments to ensure proper configuration.&nbsp; Following are the requirements we have attempted to address: <br>
</p>

<ol>

  <li>A single configuration file is used to define the environment</li>
  <li>The configuration file is easily understood and both human and machine readable</li>
  <li>There
are supporting scripts that read the configuration file and translate
it into environment settings for the currently executing program</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Support for .csh</li>
    <li>Support for .sh</li>
    <li>Support for .pl</li>
    <li>Support for programs running in the MEME Server environment</li>
    <li>Support for programs running in the MEME Client environment</li>
    <li>Support for users running in a login shell<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>There should be only one or two required environment variables (used to locate the environment file and support scripts).</li>
  <li>All scripts should function in a backwards-compatible way<br>
  </li>
</ol>

This document addresses the requirements in the following sections:
<ul>

 <li><a href="#env_prop">Environment File (env.prop)<br>
</a></li>
 <li><a href="#env_home">Environment Home ($ENV_HOME)<br>
</a></li>

</a></li>
 <li><a href="#sh">Support for .sh scripts<br>
</a></li>
 <li><a href="#pl">Support for .pl scripts<br>
</a></li>
 <li><a href="#meme">Support for MEME Client/Server components</a><br>
</li>
 <li><a href="#shell">Support for shell users (.cshrc settings)</a></li><li><a href="#apache">Apache/Tomcat</a><br>
  </li>

</ul>


<a name="env_prop"></a>
<h3>Environment Configuration File (env.prop)<br>
</h3>
For the configuration file, we chose the style of a Java
Properties file.&nbsp; This file supports comment lines (starting with
#), and name-value
pairs separated by an = sign.&nbsp; for example,<br>

<pre>#<br># This properties file should contain environment config<br># information for use by ALL applications.  It exists<br># independently of any single project.  Each installation<br># should have a single env file, and the only piece of<br># configuration info needed by applications should be the<br># location of this file<br>#<br>MEME_HOME=/d5/MEME4<br>MRD_HOME=/d5/MRD<br>EMS_HOME=/site/umls<br>MIDSVCS_HOME=/site/umls<br>LVG_HOME=/site/package/lvg/current<br>LVG_IF_HOME=/site/umls/lvg<br>ORACLE_HOME=/home/oracle/product/9.2.0<br>MEME_PROP_FILE=/d5/MEME4/bin/meme.prop<br></pre>

Each environment variable needed should be defined in this file.&nbsp;
Comments can be used to provide additional information about each
one.&nbsp; A user of this file must have a mandatory <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span>
variable set that indicates the full path to this file.&nbsp; This is
the only required variable needed to know what the environment settings
should be.&nbsp;&nbsp; ALL software components should operate in an
environment with these settings.&nbsp; Support for creating that
environment is described below.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><a name="env_home"></a>
<h3>Environment Home ($ENV_HOME)<br>
</h3>
<p>Environment support will be distributed as a single <span style="font-family: monospace;">env.zip</span> file that can be unpacked anywhere.&nbsp; It has the following structure:<br>
</p>

<pre>bin/env.csh<br>bin/env.pl<br>bin/env.sh<br>bin/README<br>conf/env.prop<br>conf/README<br>README<br></pre>

<p>To use the various scripts for supporting the environment, you must have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_HOME</span> setting equal to the full path to the top-level directory of this structure.&nbsp; The <span style="font-family: monospace;">env.prop</span> file is the default properties file that should be edited for the specific environment.&nbsp; Once ready, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> variable can be set to <span style="font-family: monospace;">$ENV_HOME/conf/env.prop</span>.<br>
</p>

<a name="csh"></a>
<h3>Support for .csh</h3>
All .csh scripts that are intended to operate in this consolidated environment can take advantage of <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_HOME</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> by including the following code snippet:<br>

<pre>source $ENV_HOME/bin/env.csh<br></pre>

The script will go through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> config file and set environment variables accordingly.<br>

<br>

<a name="sh"></a>
<h3>Support for .sh</h3>

All .sh scripts that are intended to operate in this consolidated environment can take advantage of <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_HOME</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> by including the following code snippet:<br>


<pre>. $ENV_HOME/bin/env.sh<br></pre>


The script will go through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> config file and set environment variables accordingly.<br>

<br>

<a name="pl"></a>
<h3>Support for .pl</h3>


All Perl scripts that are intended to operate in this consolidated environment can take advantage of <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_HOME</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span> by including the following code snippet:<br>



<pre>unshift @INC, "$ENV{ENV_HOME}/bin";<br>require "env.pl"<br></pre>

The script will go through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV{ENV_FILE}</span> config file and set environment variables accordingly.&nbsp; This should be used by all of the CGI scripts.<br>

<br>

<a name="meme"></a>
<h3>Support for MEME Client/Server components<br>
</h3>

All components operating in a MEME environment should have access to
the full environment through the meme.env.* properties.&nbsp; In order
to have full access to these properties in the .java environment, the
following will be required in the meme.prop or mrd.prop file used in
the startup environment.<br>




<pre>meme.env.ENV_FILE=/d5/ENV/conf/env.prop<br></pre>

The MEME init routine (whether on client/server side or in MRD), will
go through this file and generate meme.env.* properties for each
entry.&nbsp; These entries are passed through all calls to
MEMEToolkit.exec(), enabling sub-processes of the MEME server to
inherit these environment settings.&nbsp; <br>

<h3><a name="shell"></a>
</h3>

<h3>Support for Shell Users<br>
</h3>

Some processes, such as source insertion are still operated from a
shell environment.&nbsp; Ensuring that a shell user's environment is
properly configured is akin to the .csh or .sh sections above.&nbsp;
For example, a csh or tcsh user should be able to put the following
code snippet into their .cshrc file and the environment should be
properly set:<br>


<pre>setenv ENV_HOME /path/to/ENV/home<br>setenv ENV_FILE /path/to/ENV/home/conf/env.prop<br>source $ENV_HOME/bin/env.csh<br></pre>

Should the user want to use the sh shell, something akin to this would be needed:<br>

<pre>ENV_HOME=/path/to/ENV/home<br>export ENV_HOME<br>ENV_FILE=/path/to/ENV/home/conf/env.prop<br>export ENV_FILE<br>. $ENV_HOME/bin/env.sh</pre>

From this example, it should be clear how to configure additional types of shell environments.<br>

<h3><a name="apache"></a>
</h3>


<h3>Apache/Tomcat Configuration<br>
</h3>

The Apache and Tomcat environments do not need to really worry about
this as they are used as containers for calling other functions.&nbsp;
The requirements here are that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_HOME</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">$ENV_FILE</span>
values are properly passed to child processes (such as an invoked CGI
script).&nbsp; Scripts and webapps themselves are responsible for using
the architecture described above to configure the actual environment.<br>
