<h3>Overview</h3>


   
<blockquote>This document attempts to describe the important aspects of relationships,
 including how they are represented in the MID and in the Metathesaurus,
and  what rules the relationships are subjected to throughout the life cycle
of  the Metathesaurus. &nbsp;This includes, how they are inserted, what happens
 during MEME editing, how QA affects them, and how they are treated in the
 MRD and the production process. &nbsp;The following table links to sections
 describing different aspects of the relationship semantics.<br>

<h3><a name="levels"></a>Relationship Levels</h3>


  There are three relationship "levels" supported in the MID and by the MEME
 editing system. &nbsp;Details are included in the table below<br>

       <td valign="top">P level relationships are atom level relationships 
(meaning that they connect two atoms together).<br>
 These relationships are typically used to drive editing and almost always 
connect things that are semantically linked somehow.<br>
       <br>
       <i>Demotions</i> are a special category of P level relationship, and 
usually indicate that the connected thins share some kind of lexical similarity. 
&nbsp;Demotions MUST be edited before a concept is approved, and they show 
up in a special section of the concept report (paired with any matching concept 
level relationships). &nbsp;<br>

   &nbsp;
<h3><a name="mappable"></a>Mappable vs. Non-Mappable Relationships</h3>

MEME
supports connecting relationships to a variety of different kinds of identifiers.
&nbsp;Typically relationships are connected directly to atoms or concepts,
but occasionally they are connected to things like <i>a code within a source</i> or to a <i>CUI</i>.
&nbsp; The actual identifiers used to connect a relationship are stored in
the (sg_id_1, sg_type_1, sg_qualifier_1) and (sg_id_2, sg_type_2, sg_qualifier_2)
tuples. &nbsp;Certain types are considered mappable, and this set is defined
by the MID query:<br>


<pre>   SELECT code FROM code_map WHERE type = 'map_sg_type'<br></pre>


When relationships are inserted, these various types are mapped to the best matching (atom_id,concept_id) tuple by <a href="plsql_msp.html#map_sg_fields">MEME_SOURCE_PROCESSING.map_sg_fields</a>.
&nbsp;Additionally, whenever the cui assignment algorithm is run ($MEME_HOME/bin/assign_cuis.pl),
all relationships and attributes with <i>mappable</i> types are re-mapped
to the appropriate (atom_id,concept_id) pairs to ensure that the id mappings
are as current and accurate as possible.<br>


<h3><a name="cxt_rels"></a>Context Relationships vs. Normal Relationships</h3>

 
  Context, or hierarchical, relationships exist in the context_relationships
table instead of the relationships table. &nbsp;This is considered a pseudo core
table as it is maintained to a certain extent by actions but cannot be directly
edited in the editing interface. &nbsp; The following table contains information
about context relationships.<br>

<li>Context relationships are assigned RUI values.</li><li>The relationship
attribute values of context_relationships undergo a number of transformations
so that they are correctly represented in the various places they are stored.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In the .raw3 file, the relationship attribute field for a particular line represents the relationship of that row to its parent.</li>
          <li>In the contexts.src file, the relationship attribute value
is inversed from its true direction because of the way it is extracted from
the .raw3 file.</li>
          <li>When we load source_context_relationships, we inverse the relationship attribute values during <a href="/MEME/Documentation/plsql_msp.html#map_to_meme_ids">MEME_SOURCE_PROCESSING.map_to_meme_ids</a>.</li>
          <li>When context_relationships is loaded, the relationship attribute
values are expressed correctly, from the atom_id_2 to the atom_id_1 for PAR
relationships. &nbsp;For SIB relationships, the relationship_attribute values
are represented as the relationship between the atom_id_2 and its parent.</li>
          <li>When we load mrd_contexts, the relationship attribute expresses
the relationship between the aui and its parent, so it must be reversed again
from context_relationships, due to the way &nbsp;mrd_contexts is built.</li>
          <li>A mid validation check looks for relationship conflicts in
the context_relationships table to help identify these problems before a
release takes place.</li>
