<h2>
Releasing MEME4 Software</h2></center>


<hr><i>Following is a description of the software release protocol.</i>
<br>

<td nosave="">The software release policy has been drastically
simplified by the development of a perl release script.&nbsp; Click <a href="/MEME/Documentation/version_old.html">here</a>
to see how ridiculous the old policy was.&nbsp; Following are the steps
involved in releasing a MEME4 software component.
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that your release component has an entry in the
          <tt>$MEME_HOME/bin/components.info</tt>
file.&nbsp; This file has the following fields:</li>

<pre><tt>component name|type|directory|short description|long description</tt></pre>
The component name will actually be the file name for perl,
.csh, and other scripts.&nbsp; For OpenROAD components it is the application
name with <tt>.exp</tt> appended to it (e.g. <tt>molecular_actions.exp</tt>).&nbsp;
The type must be one of the existing types in the file which at present
are: <tt>cgi</tt>, <tt>csh</tt>, <tt>exp</tt>, <tt>img</tt>, <tt>perl</tt>,
        <tt>plsql</tt>,
        <tt>release_notice</tt>,
        <tt>release_status</tt>,
        <tt>properties</tt>,
        <tt>jar</tt>, and
        <tt>sql</tt>.&nbsp;
There should only be one entry for
        <tt>release_notice</tt> and one for
        <tt>release_status</tt>.&nbsp;
The directory must be one of the subdirectories of <tt>$MEME_HOME</tt>.
The short description is what appears in the <a href="/MEME/Release/Release_Status.html">release
status</a> page as the component name.&nbsp; The long description appears
on the release status page in the Description field.<br>
        <br>

<li>
Once your entry is in the components file, the next step
is to release that component by calling:</li>

<pre><tt>% release.pl &lt;component name&gt;</tt></pre>
The release script looks up your component in the components
file and performs the following operations:&nbsp; (a) the script will prompt
you for a description of the changes to the component and for any additional
comments you have, (b) it generates the release file which will be FTP'd
to NLM in the <tt>$MEME_HOME/Release</tt> directory, (c) it FTPs the release
file to the release directory at the NLM (this is specified as a variable
in <tt>release.pl</tt>).&nbsp; The release file will have the form <tt>&lt;component_name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;date&gt;.&lt;file_extension&gt;</tt>.&nbsp;
For example, you might have <tt>reports_v10.20010419.pl</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The date used comes from the current date and the version number is extracted
from the component itself.&nbsp; Each type of component must have version
information tracked in a particular format.&nbsp; Use existing script/files
as templates or see the <tt>release.pl</tt> script because the formats
are not described here.<br>

        <br>

Note: If the component is the meme.jar file, there are some additional
places to consider uploading it that the release script does not handle:<br>

        <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;
smis:../meow/jaws/apps/lib/meme.jar (signed)
smis:../meow/jaws/apps/lib/testmeme.jar (signed)
smis:/d5/MEME4/webapps-lti-dev/lib/meme.jar </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

        <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; smis:/d5/MEME4/webapps-lti/lib/meme.jar</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

        <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; smis:/d5/MEME4/cgi-lti-dev/java/meme.jar</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

        <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; smis:/d5/MEME4/cgi-lti/java/meme.jar</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">

        <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; mrd:/d5/MEME4/dev/java/meme.jar</span><br>

&nbsp; <br>

        <br>

        
<li>
The previous step should be performed for all components
that are going to be released in a single day.<br>
          <br>
</li>

<li>
Once all components have been released to NLM, the next step
is to re-generate the release status page.&nbsp; This is done by calling:</li>

<pre><tt>% release.pl Release_Status.html</tt></pre>
This generates a <a href="/MEME/Release/Release_Status.html">current
release status</a> and <a href="/MEME/Release/Release_Status_Old.html">old
release status</a> pages from the <tt>$MEME_HOME/bin/components.info</tt>
and <tt>$MEME_HOME/bin/release.info</tt> files and FTP's these pages to
the NLM (the machine/directory are stored as internal variables in <tt>release.pl</tt>).<br>
        <br>

<li>
The final step is to generate a release notice for all of
the components released.&nbsp; This is done by calling:</li>

<pre><tt>% release.pl Release_Notice.html</tt></pre>
This call produces a release notice html page in the form
        <tt>release.&lt;date&gt;.html</tt>
which is FTP'd to the same directory as the release status page.&nbsp;
Additionally, a text version of the release notice is created and emailed
to a list of recipients specified in <tt>release.pl</tt> (<tt>nlmreg@nlm.nih.gov</tt>
and <tt>meme@apelon.com</tt> are be included).<br>
