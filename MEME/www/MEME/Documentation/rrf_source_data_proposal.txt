Overview/Objective

The RRF is the standard release format for the UMLS Metathesaurus.
We would like to push its use as a standard submission format for
source providers whose terminologies will be added/updated to the
Metathesaurus.  We need to preserve the fundamental semantics of
the RRF so that it can be easily and cleanly documented and explained.


Proposal

Following is a field-by-file proposal for how the RRF will serve 
as a source insertion format and how each of the data fields will
be interpreted by our insertion formats.  Some important things we
discuss are:
1. Source Data Representation
 a. terms, attributes, relationships
2. Representing Map Sets
3. Suggesting UMLS Synonymy
4. Suggesting Default Semantic Types
5. Creating 7-bit forms
6. Choosing Term Types
7. Representing Sources as Concepts


Source Data Representation

Before we start, there are a few important concepts to understand:

"proxy ui":  
  A line-level identifier in a file indented to be a value for
  joining to other files.  Each of the Metathesaurus UI fields
  CUI, AUI, RUI, ATUI should be populated with proxy uis.  They 
  serve as unique identifiers for their respective files and when	
  they must have unique values across all files.

"proxy atom ui": 
  Must appear in AUI field in MRCONSO.RRF, one unique value per 
  line. If the source asserts SAUI values, use them here.

"proxy concept ui": 
  Must appear in CUI field in MRCONSO.RRF, one unique value 
  per source concept. If source asserts SCUI values, use them here.

"proxy attribute ui": 
  Must appear in any available ATUI field. If source asserts SATUI 
  values, use them here. Currently, these values are not used but may 
  be in the future

"proxy relationship ui": 
  Must appear in RUI field in MRREL.RRF, if source asserts SRUI values, 
  use them here.

The following section describes each RRF file in general terms.  It
indicates how the data from this file will be used in the MID by the
source insertion process.  Next, a field-by-field look is taken to
understand what data a source provider should use in each case and
exactly how it will be used by the source insertion process.  Finally,
examples are provided.  Note, many RRF files will not need to be populated
when representing source data.

MRCOC.RRF

Description: There are a few sources that supply COC other than MEDLINE, including
CCPSS and AIR.  Were these sources to be updated or were another source
to provide coocurrence data, this is where that data should be included.

For source insertion purposes: this data will be loaded into "coc_headings".
Each line of MRCOC.RRF will produce COF*2 entries in coc_headings where the
two heading ids are given the same "citation_set_id" which is uniquely assigned
and duplicated COF number of times so that when aggregated the MRCOC row is
properly reconstructed.

MRCOLS.RRF

Not used, or computed to reflect current state of the files.
Tools should be supplied.

For source insertion purposes this is used only to validate the
other content.


MRCONSO.RRF

This is the most important of the files and contains the actual terms
from the source as well as its "conceptness".  The most important
thing to understand about this file is the use of "proxy atom ui" and
"proxy concept ui".  

For source insertion purposes, this data will be loaded into "classes"
and "concept_status".  Also the index tables will be populated.

Field	   Value			   source insertion semantics
---------- ------------------------------  --------------------------------------
CUI:	   "proxy concept ui"		   Used to join to other files CUI fields.
		  			   Only used for "concept-level" data
LAT:	   ENG, SPA, etc.		   used as the language value
TS:        P,S, blank			   ignored

ISPREF:    Y,N,blank			   ignored
AUI:       "proxy atom ui"		   Used to join to other files AUI fields
					   (in particular MRREL.RRF and MRSAT.RRF).
					   This is treated like a "source_atom_id".
SAUI:      source asserted atom UI	   used as the source_aui value
SCUI:      source asserted concept UI	   used as the source_cui value.  This is how
					   source "conceptness" is expressed. Multiple
					   rows with the same SCUI mean the same thing
					   from the sources perspective.  This will lead
					   to SY merging.
SDUI:      source asserted descriptor UI   used as the source_dui value
SAB:	   RSAB value from MRSAB.RRF	   the source
TTY:       From a list of "supported"	   the tty, may be changed by us
	   TTYs: PT, SY, AB, OP, OS, OA,   to preserve Meta notion of TTY
	   CD, IN, OCD, BN, etc..

MRHIST.RRF

This is where source history information is stored.  This is the actual
source history information tracked by the source. MRHIST.RRF rows should
be attached to the proper SOURCEUI.

Question: Should source providers provide their own SRC concepts?


MRSAT.RRF

This is where source attributes are stored.  Attributes may exist an any level
in a source but must be assigned a "proxy atom ui" to represent the class level at
which they are connected.  The STYPE field indicates which MRCONSO, or MRREL field 
is actually the level at which relationships are connected.

MRSTY.RRF

This is where default semantic type suggestions go.  Semantic types are ultimately overridden
by editors (and inversion) but this is where source providers can supply us with
suggestions.  We can release tools to help build defaults from their hierarchy

Representing Map Sets

When RRF is used to represent a mapping set, either MRMAP.RRF or 
MRSMAP.RRF should be used in conjunction with MRCONSO.RRF and 
MRSAT.RRF.  A map set starts with a MRCONSO row representing the
"map set concept".  For example,

100046|ENG||||||3342||100046||SNOMEDCT|XM|100046|SNOMEDCT mappings to ICD-9-CM|4|N||

Next, a series of MRSAT.RRF entries should be used to specify
certain important features of the map set.

Finally, the map set should list the actual mappings in the appropriate
file.  MRMAP.RRF should be used if MRSMAP.RRF does not have sufficient 
richness represent the source mappings.  

This data will be stored in the attributes table.  Each mapping is
represented by three attributes: XMAPTO, XMAP, XMAPFROM.  This allows
the "from" and "to" objects to be re-used across multiple mappings.

Here are the fields for MRMAP.RRF.  MRSMAP.RRF uses a subset of these.

Suggesting UMLS Synonymy

In many cases, sources might wish to explicitly suggest synonymy
with UMLS CUIs.  This suggested synonymy can be indicated by supplying
MRREL rows with the following characteristics
1. REL=SY
2. AUI1="proxy atom ui" representing the source concept to merge with UMLS CUI
3. CUI2=suggested synonymous UMLS CUI value
4. STYPE2=CUI

During the source insertion process, these relationships will be
represented as SY relationships.  A merge facts set will always be
performed to attempt to merge across a source's SY facts.


Suggesting Default Semantic Types

Sources should be encouraged to submit their own default semantic type 
suggestions.  This can be done by using the MRSTY file, since sources
do not natively contain UMLS semantic type information.  One of the
tools that can be built and supplied with the RRF documentation/training
is one that makes use of the hierarchies (like we do in inversion) to
create and inherit default STYs down the hierarchies.


Creating 7-bit forms

Whenever a non-ASCII string, definition, or attribute is created,
the source provider should create a pure-ASCII 7-bit version as well.
One of the tools that can be built and supplied with the RRF documentation/
training is one to generate default 7-bit froms from non-ASCII UTF-8.


Choosing Term Types

One big challenge for users of the RRF as a source submission format
will be to use TTYs properly.   We should use the previous release MRDOC
as the gold standard and train users to choose from the available set
with certain ones (like PT, SY) being preferred over others (like MH, or N1).
Generally, source providers should not be allowed to create entirely NEW
TTY values.  NLM should also reserve the right to override source
provider TTY suggestions to avoid conflicts.


Representing Sources as Concepts

Each new source will require a new SRC concept.  Most of this information
can come from the MRSAB.RRF file.  WE should require that certain MRSAB.RRF
fields are populated (like source official name, source short name, etc).
We should also standardize the use of SRC/RHT to represent the context
tree-top.
