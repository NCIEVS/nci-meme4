<h2> Caching Architecture</h2>
</center>
 
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
MEME employs a sophsticated data caching mechanism to keep in memory objects
which are commonly used but which do not change very frequently. &nbsp;Along
with this is a mechanism to refresh the cache while the server/client are
running to account for known changes. <br>
  <h3>Server Side Caching<br>
  </h3>
During the server intitialization routine, while it is creating data source
connections, we cache all of the following data structures based on the data
in the database being connected to.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Languages. This data comes from the <tt>language</tt> table and is
represented as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Language.html">Language</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Sources. This data comes from <tt>source_rank</tt>, <tt>sims_info</tt>,
and <tt>classes</tt> and is represented as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Source.html">Source</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Termgroups. This data comes from <tt>termgroup_rank</tt> and is represented
as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Termgroup.html">Termgroup</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Semantic types. This data comes from <tt>semantic_types</tt> and
is represented as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/SemanticType.html">SemanticType</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Relationship names and inverses. This data comes from <tt>inverse_relationships</tt>
and is represented as Strings in a HashMap.</li>
    <li>Relationship attributes and inverses. This data comes from <tt>inverse_rel_attributes</tt>
and is represented as Strings in a HashMap.</li>
    <li>Code/Value mappings. This data comes from <tt>code_map</tt> and is
represented as Strings in a HashMap.</li>
    <li>Editor preferences. This data comes from editors and <tt>editor_preferences</tt>
and is represented as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/EditorPreferences.html">EditorPreferences</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Integrities. This data comes from <tt>integrity_constraints</tt>,
      <tt>ic_pair</tt>, and <tt>ic_single</tt> and is represented as <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/integrity/IntegrityCheck.html">IntegrityCheck</a>
objects.</li>
    <li>Valid values for status, tobereleased, released, and level. This
data comes from <tt>level_status_rank</tt>, <tt>tobereleased_rank</tt>, and
      <tt>released_rank</tt> and is represented in a HashMap.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
This caching takes place in <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/sql/MIDConnection.html">MIDConnection</a>/<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/sql/MEMEConnection.html">MEMEConnection</a>
in the <tt>refreshCaches()</tt> method which is called by the constructor.
If changes to these data structures are known to have taken place, all of
the active data sources can be refreshed by calling the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/server/MIDDataSourcePool.html">MIDDataSourcePool</a>
method&nbsp;<tt>refreshCaches()</tt>. &nbsp; These methods are public and
may be called at any time by server-side components.<br>
  <br>
It is also important to note that the data source connections add to their
caches as new objects are created in response to users connecting to different
databases. &nbsp;For example, if a new source is inserted into <tt>oc_testsrc</tt>
but the server was started against <tt>oa_mid2004</tt> and a user makes a
request to generate a concept report against <tt>oc_testsrc</tt> using a
  <tt>concept_id</tt> that contains the new source, a new&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Source.html">Source</a>
object will be created and added to the cache for that&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/sql/MIDConnection.html">MIDConnection</a>
even though it is connected to&nbsp;<tt>oa_mid2004</tt>.<br>
  <br>
This is not the only type of caching that takes place. &nbsp;The <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/MIDServices.html">MIDServices</a>
object caches the table of key/value mappings stored on the mid services
server. &nbsp; This is done via a&nbsp;<tt>refreshCaches()</tt> method which
is called when any of the&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/MIDServices.html">MIDServices</a>
methods relating to the mid services list are called (note calling a method
to normalize a string does not fill the cache). &nbsp;This method is public
and may be called at any time by server-side components.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
One enhancement to the caching architecture that may be added in the future
is the caching of <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Concept.html">Concept</a>
objects. &nbsp;Currently, these objects are re-read from the database each
time they are needed instead of being maintained in memory on the server
side. &nbsp;If it turns out that maintaining them on the server side is not
too difficult and will contribute to a boost in performance, it will be implemented.
&nbsp; One of the difficult issues is that&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Concept.html">Concept</a>
objects may not be fully populated by a source, so maintaining it will require
keeping track of how fully populated concept objects are and only using the
cache if a request needs a&nbsp;<a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/common/Concept.html">Concept</a>
in exactly the state it is cached.<br>
  <h3>Client Side Caching</h3>
While client applications make use of the server side caches, there is a
certain amount of caching that happens on their end too. &nbsp;In particular,
the <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/AuxiliaryDataClient.html">AuxiliaryDataClient</a>
caches most of the data behind the various methods it has to return objects.
&nbsp;This allows the client to use the methods repeatedly without having
additional requests be sent to the server. &nbsp; If it is known that this
data has changed, or if the client wishes to use a new data source, then
the cache should be cleared (using <tt>clearCaches()</tt>) so that future
requests can repopulate the cache from the current data source.<br>
  <br>
If a client happens to know that data cached by the server is stale, this
can be resolved from the client side via an <a
 href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/client/AdminClient.html">AdminClient</a>
method called&nbsp;<tt>refreshCaches()</tt>. &nbsp;This method invokes the
various server side&nbsp;<tt>refreshCaches()</tt> methods described above,
repopulating the MIDServices and data source connections.<br>
