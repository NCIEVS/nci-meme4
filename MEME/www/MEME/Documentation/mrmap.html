<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> This document describes how mappings are to be represented in the
Metathesaurus RRF as well as how MetamorphoSys, the MID, UMLS object
model, and MEME data structures should accommodate this data.</p>

<h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
In order to choose well how to represent this information it is
important to understand conceptually the different parts of the
mappings. We see that there are essentially three conceptual data
structures which must be represented.
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><b> MapSet</b></dt>
    <dd> This is the top level data structure and represents a
collections of mappings from one kind of UI or UI expression to another
kind of UI or UI expression. A map set contains information like the
name of the map set, the identifier for the map set, the map set
version, and some of the
various other attributes used by this map set (such as the from ui list
separator). One restriction/limitation imposed on a MapSet is that it
is owned by a particular version of a source (MABSETVSAB) and must
contain mappings only from one source (FROMVSAB) to another source
(TOVSAB). Mappings between other pairs of sources must belong to a
different map set.&nbsp; Each map set is represented as a concept in
the Metathesaurus, and updated versions of map sets are represented as
separate concepts.&nbsp; Multiple versions of a map set are allowed to
exist simultaneously in the Metathesaurus, but when one is made
obsolete, a bequeathal relationship should connect it to the current
version of the map set.&nbsp; This means that each subsequent version
of a map set has a different CUI representing it in MRCONSO.RRF.<br>
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b> Mapping</b></dt>
    <dd>This represents a mapping from an identifier or expression to
another identifier or expression. It is conceptually part of a map set.
Mappings are occasionally grouped together into subsets with an
ordering imposed over them. (e.g. SNOMED-ICD9 reimbursement
mappings).&nbsp; This object will have a UMLS asserted identifier and
may have a source asserted identifier.<br>
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b>MapObject</b> (aka "map from" and "map to")</dt>
    <dd>A mapping may connect some kind of identifier (like a SNOMEDCT
concept id) to another kind of identifier. These "from" and "to"
objects are abstractions allowing mappings to connect complex sets,
lists, or expressions of identifiers to one another. This object will
have a UMLS asserted identifier and may have a source asserted
identifier. </dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<a name="rrf"></a>
<h3>Rich Release Format</h3>
<p> The proposal is to represent mappings in the RRF in four parts. The
first part is the map set concept, represented in the example below by
a MRCONSO entry with TTY=XM. The atom name is a descriptive name for
the map set and should include information about the versions of the
two sources being mapped. One result of using versioned source names is
that subsequent updates to the map set XM atom will wind up in new
Metathesaurus concepts (with new CUIs). The offical map set name from
the source is
encoded as an attribute (as you will see later). The code of the XM
atom is the MAPSETSID, or if that is null, then a maintained "MTHU#"
code will be used. The concept will
also require an "Intellectual
Product" semantic type.</p>
<pre>  MRCONSO:<br>  --------<br>    C2000039|ENG|P|L2354989|PF|S2464922|Y|A3528280||||SNOMEDCT|XM|100046|SNOMEDCT_2006_07_31 to ICD9CM_2006 Mappings|0|N|<br><br>  MRSTY:<br>  ------<br>    C2000039|T170|A2.4|Intellectual Product|AT17737406||<br></pre>
<p> This is the starting point for investigating the mappings. The next
part is a series of attributes which appear in MRSAT connected to the
XM CUI. For SNOMEDCT at least the following attributes will be
associated with the map set (shown are the attribute names and values)
and owned by the current version of SNOMEDCT.&nbsp; Those entries with
a * are <span style="font-style: italic;">required</span>.<br>
</p>
<pre>  MRSAT.ATN,ATV:<br>  --------------<br>    MAPSETSID|100046<br>    MAPSETNAME|ICD-9-CM  // ONLY use this if source asserts its own map set name<br>    *MAPSETVERSION|20060731<br>    MAPSETTYPE|2<br>    MAPSETSEPARATORCODE|&amp;#x7C;<br>  &nbsp; MAPSETXRTARGETID|100051<br>    MAPSETSCHEMEID|2.16.840.1.113883.6.5.2.1<br>    MAPSETSCHEMENAME|International Classification of Diseases ...<br>    MAPSETSCHEMEVERSION|2002<br>    MAPSETREALMID|<br>    MAPSETRULETYPE|<br>    TARGETSCHEMEID|2.16.840.1.113883.6.5.2.1<br></pre>
In addition, this concept will contain attributes further describing
the map set.&nbsp; These are also owned by the same SAB as the
MAPSETVSAB.&nbsp; Those entries with a * are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">required</span>.<br>
<pre>  MRSAT.ATN,ATV:<br>  --------------<br>    MTH_UMLSMAPSETSEPARATOR|,<br>    *FROMVSAB|SNOMEDCT_2006_07_31<br>    *FROMRSAB|SNOMEDCT<br>    *TOVSAB|ICD9CM_2006<br>    *TORSAB|ICD9CM<br>    *MAPSETVSAB|SNOMEDCT_2006_07_31<br>    *MAPSETRSAB|SNOMEDCT<br></pre>
Finally, we can have a standard set of "extended" attributes to
describe the nature of the map set. These attributes are owned by the
same SAB as the MAPSETVSAB. For example:
<pre>  MRSAT.ATN,ATV<br>  --------------<br>    SOS|This set maps SNOMEDCT concept identifiers to ICD-9-CM codes<br>        where a single concept id can be mapped to one or more codes, etc.<br>    MTH_MAPSETCOMPLEXITY|N_TO_ONE<br>    MTH_MAPFROMCOMPLEXITY|SINGLE SCUI<br>    MTH_MAPTOCOMPLEXITY|SINGLE SCUI, MULTIPLE SCUI<br>    MTH_MAPTOEXHAUSTIVE|N<br>    MTH_MAPFROMEXHAUSTIVE|N<br></pre>
<p> Additional attributes can easily be added to accommodate the
specific needs of certain mapping sets (like associated
expressions).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Valid values for MTH_MAPFROMCOMPLEXITY and MTH_MAPTOCOMPLEXITY have two
parts: the degree (SINGLE, MULTIPLE, BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION) and the type
(STR, CODE, SCUI, SDUI, CUI) separated by a space.&nbsp; A comma separated list can be used
to represent multiple values.<br>
<br>
Valid values for MTH_MAPSETCOMPLEXITY include: N_TO_ONE, N_TO_N, ONE_TO_ONE, and ONE_TO_N.&nbsp; This indicates how many mappings a single
"FROM" expression will have and how many mappings a single "TO"
expression will have.&nbsp; For example, in the SNOMEDCT to ICD9CM map
set, each SNOMEDCT FROMEXPR has only a single mapping, but an ICD9CM
TOEXPR may correspond with multiple SNOMEDCT concepts, thus the
complexity is "N_TO_ONE" (N FROMEXPRs map TO ONE TOEXPR).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>The STYPE of these attributes should always be CODE.<br>
</p>
<p>The MAPSETTYPE should describe the "kind" of mappings in this set.  It should either have a source provided value 
(like in the example above) or should be one of the supported stock values.  These include.
<ul><li>ATX - for Associated Expressions mappings</li>
<li>SIMPLE - basic mappings that either do not use MAPSUBSETID or have exactly the same trivial value in every record (e.g. "0" or "0:0")</li>
<li>RULE_BASED - complex mappings that fully utilize the MAPSUBSETID and MAPRANK semantics<br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The third part of the mapping structure is the MRMAP file itself.
It contains information about what is mapped to what and what source is
responsible for the mapping. The following proposal is designed to be
as flexible as possible looking forward.</p>
<pre>  MRMAP:<br>  ------<br>    MAPSETCUI: CUI of the map set<br>    MAPSETSAB: SAB of the map set<br>    MAPSUBSETID: Map subset identifier used to identify a subset of related mappings within a map set<br>    MAPRANK: Order in which mappings in a subset should be applied<br>    MAPID: Metathesaurus asserted identifier for mapping<br>    MAPSID: Source asserted identifier for mapping<br>    FROMID: Metathesaurus identifier for the entity being mapped from<br>    FROMSID: Source asserted identifier for the entity being mapped from<br>    FROMEXPR: The expression that a mapping is mapped from<br>    FROMTYPE: The type of expression that a mapping is mapped from<br>    FROMRULE: Machine processible rule applicable to the entity being mapped from<br>    FROMRES: Restriction applicable to the entity being mapped from<br>    REL: Relationship<br>    RELA: Relationship attribute<br>    TOID: Metathesaurus identifier for the entity being mapped to<br>    TOSID: Source asserted identifier for the entity being mapped to<br>    TOEXPR: The expression that a mapping is mapped to<br>    TOTYPE: The type of expression that a mapping is mapped to<br>    TORULE: Machine processible rule applicable to the entity being mapped to<br>    TORES: Restriction applicable to the entity being mapped to<br>    MAPRULE: Machine processible rule applicable to this mapping<br>    MAPRES: Restriction applicable to this mapping<br>    MAPTYPE: Type of mapping<br>    MAPATN: Mapping attribute name (for future use)<br>    MAPATV: Mapping attribute value (for future use)<br>    CVF: Content view flag<br></pre>
A sample row might look like this:
<pre>  MRMAP:<br>  ------<br>    C2000039|SNOMEDCT|||AT00312345|439234392|1001||212874005|SCUI|||RN||4023|9533976055|040.3,041.84|CODE|||||2||||<br></pre>
There are a few notes about this structure.
<ol>
  <li>The MAPSETCUI field should contain the CUI of the map set concept
in MRCONSO</li>
  <li>The FROMID and TOID are the "source id" and "target id" used by
the XMAPFROM and XMAPTO in the MID. They do not have a type because
they are just ids for the MapObjects on each side of the mapping.</li>
  <li>The FROMEXPR and TOEXPR can be simple or complex expressions. </li>
  <li>The FROMTYPE, TOTYPE should be bounded sets of possible values
which appear in MRDOC. Here are initial suggestions for valid types:
    <pre>     CUI, AUI, SCUI, SDUI, SAUI, CODE, <br>     BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION_{type} (e.g. BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION_STR)<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>We believe that the original style MR file MRATX should be folded
into the MRMAP data structure. We can create the relevant MID data
structures (including XM concepts) to represent the "ATX" mappings and
the "Locators". A proposal for this will be submitted separately.</li>
  <li>MAPSUBSETID is the MRMAP implementation of the SNOMEDCT MapGroup
It can also be used more generically to just represent a subgrouping of
mappings within a map set.</li>
  <li>MAPRANK is the MRMAP implementation of the SNOMEDCT MapOption. It
can also be used more generically to order the entries within a
subgroup. The SNOMEDCT MapPriority will (for now) be represented as a
MAPATN/MAPATV</li>
  <li>MAPTYPE is the MRMAP implementation of the SNOMEDCT MapCategory.
More generally, it describes the type of mapping, e.g. "ATX" for former
MRATX data.</li>
  <li>MAPRULE/MAPRES are the MRMAP implementations of the SNOMEDCT
MapRule and MapAdvice fields. They are intended to represent
information about how and when to use certain mappings based on machine
or human readable rules.</li>
  <li>We have MAPSETVSAB and MAPSETRSAB attributes in the MapSet
concept, but we also have a MAPSETSAB field in MRMAP so that it is
easier for MMSYS to handle this data structure. This is either
versioned or root based on your MMSYS configuration.</li>
</ol>
The fourth part of the mapping structure is the MRSMAP file which is a
projection of MRMAP which represents only the simple mappings and does
so without all of the fields that make MRMAP both powerful and
confusing.
<pre>  MRSMAP:<br>  -------<br>    MAPSETCUI: Unique identifier for the map set concept<br>    MAPSETSAB: Source abbreviation for the map set<br>    MAPID: Mapping ID (ATUI value of XMAP)<br>    MAPSID: Source asserted Mapping ID<br>    FROMEXPR: Expression mapped from<br>    FROMTYPE: Type of mapped from expression<br>    REL: Relationship<br>    RELA: Relationship attribute<br>    TOEXPR: Expression mapped to<br>    TOTYPE: Type of mapped to expression<br>    CVF: Content view flag<br></pre>
A sample row might look like this:
<pre>  MRSMAP:<br>  -------<br>    C2000039|SNOMEDCT|AT0343929|240039123|212874005|SCUI|RN||040.3,041.84|CODE||<br></pre>
<p> We keep the TYPE fields so that it is clear what kind of
identifiers are used for the expressions. It is recommended that only
the "simple" mappings be included in MRSMAP which means mappings that
do not make use of the MAPSUBSETID and MAPRANK fields. Those entries
are considered "compound" mappings.<br>
<br>
In some cases, mappings are redundantly represented as relationships in
MRREL.&nbsp; Relationships are created from mappings only if these
things are the case:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>FROMEXPR and TOEXPR are single UI expressions</li>
  <li>Map set is not rule-based</li>
  <li>REL is not XR</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> It is possible that only portions of a map set are redundantly
represented (if some of the data meets these restrictions but not
all).&nbsp; These relationships have the same SAB as the map set and
are not labelled in any special way.&nbsp; Thus, to determine if a
relationship from a particular SAB is based on MRMAP data or based on
native source asserted relationships, a user must rely on documentation.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that we may have the need to
arbitrarily extend the MRMAP data model. One obvious way to extend
MRMAP is to allow ATUI attributes in MRSAT to be associated with MAPID
values (which will be ATUI values). In this way, arbitrary additional
attributes can be added to a mapping.
</p>
<a name="mid"></a>
<h3>MID Representation</h3>
<p> Representation in the MID is very similar to that in the release.
There will be a concept containing an atom with an XM termgroup which
names the subset and represents the concept that means that subset
(this is where MRCONSO data comes from). The various metadata
attributes will be connected to this atom in the attributes table.
</p>
<p> The mappings themselves will be represented as micro-syntax rows in
the attributes table with attribute_name = 'XMAP' and attached to the
XM atom for the map set. These attributes values will be ~ separated
fields, one for each of the following MRMAP fields:
</p>
<pre>    MAPSUBSETID: Map sub set identifier<br>    MAPRANK: Order in which mappings in a subset should be applied<br>    FROMID: Identifier mapped from<br>    REL: Relationship<br>    RELA: Relationship attribute<br>    TOID: Identifier mapped to<br>    MAPRULE: Machine processable rule for when to apply mapping<br>    MAPTYPE: Type of mapping<br>    MAPATN: Row level attribute name associated with this mapping<br>    MAPATV: Row level attribute value associated with this mapping<br>    MAPSID: Source asserted Mapping ID<br>    MAPRES: Human readable restriction use of mapping<br></pre>
<p> The two fields at the end are out of order because they were added
after the fact and the remaining structure continues to work for
backwards compatability.
</p>
<p> There will be one XMAP attribute per "mapping". For example, one
row might have an attribute value like this:
</p>
<pre>  attributes:<br>  -----------<br>    XMAP|~~212874005~RN~~9533976055~~2~~~~<br></pre>
<p> The FROMID and TOID are essentially pointers to XMAPFROM and XMAPTO
attributes which represent the identifiers or combinations of
identifiers used at each end of the mappings. These attributes will be
represented as micro-syntax rows in the attributes table with the
attribute_name of 'XMAPTO' or 'XMAPFROM and also attached to the XM
atom. For each mapping the FROMID will be represented by an XMAPTO
entry, and the TOID by an XMAPTO entry. These attributes will be ~
separated fields, one for each of the following fields:
</p>
<pre>    ID: Identifier mapped to<br>    SID: Source asserted identifier mapped to<br>    EXPR: Expression mapped to<br>    TYPE: Type of mapped to expression<br>    RULE: Machine processable rule for when this "mapped from/to" is valid<br>    RES: Restriction on when this "mapped from/to" should be used<br></pre>
Here is a sample XMAPFROM attribute value:
<pre>  attributes:<br>  -----------<br>    XMAPFROM|1001~~212874005~SCUI~~<br></pre>
Here is a sample XMAPTO attribute value:
<pre>  attributes:<br>  -----------<br>    XMAPTO|4003~9533976055~040.3,041.84~CODES~~<br></pre>
<p> It is important to represent map "to" and "from" objects separately
from mappings in the MID because it is an editing envrionment. An
editor should be able to change the definition of a "to id" without
affecting the (possibly many) mappings connected to that id. For the
release, we merely join the XMAPFROM and XMAPTO attributes back to the
XMAP attributes to build the MRMAP file.
</p>
<a name="objects"></a>
<h3>UMLS Objects API</h3>
<p> The object API should be able to "natively" represent UMLS data
structures, and so there is a Mapping object that reflects the MRMAP
field structure. It also supports MapSet and shared MapFrom (for
XMAPFROM) and MapTo (for XMAPTO) objects so that the mapping structure
can be navigated completely from the object perspective.
</p>
<a name="meme"></a>
<h3>MEME Representation</h3>
<p> MEME implements the following objects.
</p>
<pre>  MapSet extends Concept<br>  Mapping extends Attribute<br>  MapObject extends Attribute<br></pre>
<p> There is also a MEME client/service for providing editing functions
to mappings from within MEME.
</p>
<a name="src"></a>
<h3>.src File Representation</h3>
<p> Inversion will produce load files containing the various data
structures so that they can be loaded into the MID. Following are
samples of .src files containing the various atoms and attributes. </p>
<pre>  classes_atoms.src:<br>  ------------------<br>    72673553|SNOMEDCT_2006_07_31|SNOMEDCT_2006_07_31/XM|100046|N|Y|N|SNOMEDCT2006_07_31 to ICD9CM_2006 Mappings|N|100046|||ENG|1947543|<br></pre>
Note, the code of the XM atom should be the MAPSETSID (if exists),
otherwise a maintained "MTHU#" code.&nbsp; Next we have the semantic
type for this
concept.

<p> Next are the various source-specific attributes for this map set.

they are source level attributes attached by CODE_ROOT_SOURCE (to ensure STYPE=CODE in MRSAT).<br>

&nbsp;Here is a sample XMAP entry. It has the same attribute_value
fields as described in the MID section above.

The mapping example below connects the following XMAPFROM and XMAPTO.

<p> It is worth noting that all of the attributes are attached to the
XM atom. The entire map set is represented by this single concept, and
each of the mappings is an attribute of the concept, and each map
object (mapped to and mapped from) is an attribute of the concept.

<h3>Additional Examples</h3>
<p> It may be helpful to see a couple of additional examples. Following
are some sample MRCONSO rows for a couple of potential map sets.
