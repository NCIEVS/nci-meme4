Process</FONT></B></H3>
<P>Inversion is the process of transforming source data from its original format 
to the MEME load format, often referred to as ".src" (pronounced "dot-S-R-C") 
format. In general, source-specific scripts are written to manipulate the data 
to create the following files which will be described in more detail below. See 
the <A href="/MEME/Training/glossary.html">glossary 
</A>for additional details. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>classes_atoms.src - Contains the "atoms" or terms from the source, along 
  with the termtype, source unique identifiers. 
  <LI>mergefacts.src - Contains information asserting that two atoms should be 
  merged, i.e. put into the same concept 
  <LI>relationships.src - Contains relationships asserted by the source, which 
  can be within-source or cross-source. 
  <LI>attributes.src - Contains additional data found in the source or added 
  during Metathesaurus construction, including definitions, semantic types, and 
  mapping data. 
  <LI>sources.src - metadata file for information about the source itself 
  <LI>termgroups.src - file for ranking termgroup precedence, labelling 
  termgroup suppressibility and rules for matching. 
  <LI>contexts.src - hierarchy data 
  <LI>MRDOC.RRF - local version of <A 
  href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/meta2.html">MRDOC.RRF </A>with 
  source-specific additions. </LI></UL>

<H3><A name=Getsource></A><B><FONT size=+0>Get the source from NLM: 
</FONT></B></H3>
<UL>
  <LI>NLM should always have an authoritative copy of the source on 
  umls-source:/umls/Sources. Occasionally, Apelon may receive files or updates 
  directly from the source provider, and will be responsible for making sure NLM 
  is up-to-date. 
  <LI>Create an appropriate directory for the source at Apelon (e.g. under 
  /net/apollo/d1/umls/sources/2006). Create an Orig subdirectory and save the 
  original data files there. 
  <LI>Read all accompanying documents, letters, notes, etc. 
  <LI>If possible, establish contact person for source. Depending on the source, 
  Apelon may need to go through NLM to answer questions/resolve issues, or it 
  may be appropriate to interact directly with the source provider 
  <LI>If needed, translate/extract into plain text/utf-8 format (e.g. if the 
  data is in an excel spreadsheet). Officially, NLM is responsible for 
  translating data into UTF-8, however it may be helpful for Apelon to work with 
  them on this step. If the data is not delivered in plain text format, be sure 
  NLM is aware of this and understands what steps Apelon is taking to transform 
  the data. 
  <LI>Enter appropriate information in <A 
  href="/cgi-lti-oracle/SIMS.cgi">SIMS</A> re directory, 
  contact, etc. If this is an update source, you can clone the record from the 
  previous version, otherwise create a new record. If you are not sure what the 
  SAB will be, you may want to hold off on this step. </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=Groksource></A><B><FONT size=+0>Grok the source:</FONT></B></H3>
<P><BR>Start thinking about the following questions: (You may not be able to 
answer them all right away, and some of your answers will probably change as you 
delve deeper into the source.) 
<UL>
  <LI>Is it a new source or an update? 
  <LI>What is a term/atom? Are there problems with some terms not being fully 
  specified? 
  <LI>Is there synonymy? Is the synonymy "good" i.e. do we want to merge based 
  on the source's assertion of synonymy? 
  <LI>What is the code? Does it mean something (e.g. does it imply a particular 
  hierarchical position?) If there are synonyms, do they all have the same code? 

  <LI>Are there SAUIs? SCUIs? SDUIs? 
  <LI>What are the relationships? Can they be mapped to Meta relationships 
  (SY/BT/NT/RT/RT?)? Are there any RELAs? 
  <LI>Is there a hierarchy? How is it encoded? 
  <LI>Any attributes? (Definitions, semantic type, cross references to other 
  sources, external codes, etc?) 
  <LI>Any mappings to other sources? </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=qainputfile></A><B><FONT size=+0>Do some QA on the input file 
(appropriate QA will depend on the format):</FONT></B> </H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Are there the expected number of fields on each line? 
  <LI>Is the format consistent? Are field-delimiters always the same? 
  <LI>Are there record delimiters? 
  <LI>Can the format be processed as-is or does it need some 
  transformation/tweaking? </LI></UL>
<DIR>There may be cases where it is VERY difficult to extract the relevant 
information from the original input files. We need to decide, along with NLM, 
whether it is really worth the effort. E.g, for an important source like ICD-9, 
it is worth spending even several days manipulating what starts as a PDF file. 
With other sources, if some or all of the data does not readily lend itself to 
manipulation, we may want to skip it, or, depending on what information it is, 
we may just "cram" it into attributes.src as-is. Note that for NLM to be able to 
have input here, they need a good sense of how much effort it would actually 
be.</DIR>
<P>Think about the inversion from 2 perspectives: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Look at every piece of information in the source files and decide: 
  <UL>
    <LI>does this belong in the Metathesaurus? 
    <LI>if so, how will we represent it? <BR>In the spirit of "source 
    transparency," it is desirable to represent every data element from the 
    source in the UMLS. However, there are times when this is not reasonable or 
    feasible, so it is important to actively decide whether or not to include 
    every type of information. 
    <P></P></LI></UL>
  <LI>Decide how to "fill" all the required fields in the .src format, and 
  whether to fill other fields. </LI></UL>
<DIR>
<DIR>(e.g. many fields in classes_atoms.src are "required" so you'll have to 
figure out what to put in each of them, though for the first pass or two you may 
use dummy values; relationships.src is not required, but you should think 
explicitly about whether there *is* actually any relationship information that 
could be extracted from the source).</DIR></DIR>
<H3><A name=updates></A><FONT size=+0><B>For update sources:</FONT></B></H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Find the old version of the source (grep &lt;RSAB&gt; 
  /d1/umls/mgmt/termids). 
  <LI>Look at any information on <A 
  href="/cgi-lti-oracle/SIMS.cgi">SIMS</A> or meow that 
  is available on the previous version 
  <LI>Find the inversion scripts &amp; original input files. If the original 
  input format is essentially the same, you may be able to clone the inversion 
  script &amp; make minimal changes. 
  <LI>As you are working, you should be creating a "source inversion proposal." 
  This should be based on the template at: 
  /usr/tools/src/si_proposal_generic.txt and should be called 
  "si_proposal_<SAB>.txt. This needs to be reviewed and approved by NLM before 
  the inversion is considered complete. 
  <LI>Look in the last release <A 
  href="/MRD/Documentation/release_index.html">QA files 
  </A>if you need to see how things were actually released (as opposed to how 
  they were inverted; currently, it is unlikely that data was changed directly 
  in the database, but occasionally this can be an issue). Also, various counts 
  in the QA reports may be useful when comparing versions </LI></UL>

<LI>Do the inversion</B></H2>
<P><A name=createsrc></A>
<H3><B>Create preliminary .src files</B></H3>Normally, it is a good idea to 
create .src files as quickly as possible, don't worry too much about all the 
values of flags, etc. Often, creating these files and running them through QA 
can help turn up problems that might otherwise not be discovered till very late 
in the process, when they're harder to fix. Just keep remaking the .src files 
till all is correct! You probably need to create classes_atoms.src first, but 
the rest can be made in any order, and you may want to make sure you get 
classes_atoms.src on the right track before trying to deal with the other files. 
Important: Any time you rebuild classes_atoms.src, you need to rebuild other 
files that rely on source_atom_ids! For example, if any source_atom_ids change 
and you do not rebuild contexts, your contexts will be attached to the wrong 
atoms! 
<P>
<H3><A name=SRCinfo></A><B>Creating SRC atoms using SRCbuilder.pl</B></H3>Use 
the perl script SRCbuilder.pl to create all of your SRC atoms, attributes, 
merges and relationships. SRCbuilder uses information in 'sources.src' and 
'src_data'. 
<P><B>Gather information for the SRC concepts and create src_data information 
for SRC concept</B> 
<P><B>sources.src</B> - a standard sources.src file. If you are building root 
atoms you don't need to include a Root version of the source. SRCbuilder will 
handle that automatically. 
<P>See <A 
href="/Inversion/invert_meme4.html#sources">sources.src</A> 
for details of fields. The following may also be useful in creating sources.src: 

<P>
<UL>
  <LI>/usr/tools/src/sources.src.template - template to fill in sources.src 
  fields. These are easier to work with one-per-line with tags and explanations 
  than all fields on one line 
  <LI>/usr/tools/src/make.sources.src.pl - script that uses sources.src.template 
  to create sources.src file 
  <LI>/usr/tools/src/check_sources.src.pl - script to print report from 
  sources.src as well as SRC data. This is normally what should be sent to NLM 
  for review of metadata. </LI></UL>
<P><B>src_data</B> - a file with one record for each SY, SSN or HT atom that you 
wish to make. PTs, ABs, STYs, etc. are made automatically. You don't need SSN 
and HT lines if you are building versioned atoms only, so if this is an update 
source, you probably don't need this file. 
<P>Comments and blank lines are ignored. 'R' coded items are ignored unless the 
'-n' flag is used. 
<P><PRE>  The file looks like this:
  Source_Name|Code|Type|Data|
  Source_Name - must match the source_name (field 1) in sources.src 
  Code        - V|R (Root or Versioned)
  Type        - SY|HT
  Data        - String to be used
  
  examples:
  ---- src_data -------------------------------------------------------
  # SRC data for HCPCS
  HCPCS03|R|SSN|Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System|

  HCPCS03|V|SOS|Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). Washington (DC):
        Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2003.|

  # feel free to use comments and blank lines to make the file
  # more readable
  HCPCS03|V|SY|Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure 
  Coding System, 2003|
  ---- end of src_data -------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<P>Things you may want to include in src_data:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The source abbreviation (SAB) (SRC/[RV]AB) * 
  <LI>The "treetop" atom if the source has contexts (SRC/RHT) * 
  <LI>Any additional synonyms for the source name (SRC/[RV]SYs) ** </LI></UL>
<DIR>* required for inversion 
<P>** not required at inversion time, but good to have ASAP because it's harder 
to add later</P></DIR>
<P>TIP: You can build the SRCbuilder.pl script into your inversion script. See 
the templates in /d1/tools/src. 
<P>Use /d1/tools/src/SRCbuilder.pl -h for the online help file. 
<P>Template scripts using SRCbuilder.pl are available in /d1/tools/src/ for 
either perl (SRCtemplate.pl) or C shell (SRCtemplate.csh) scripts. 
<P>For more information on SRC atoms see: <A 
href="/Inversion/New_SRC_Concept_Structure.html">New SRC 
Concept Structure </A>
<P>
<H3>SRC atoms and Foreign Sources</H3>Each foreign source gets its own ENGLISH 
SRC atoms. In the past, these needed to be in a separate file, but now they can 
be in the same file (we can have more than one language per file). Normally, you 
will have one or more subdirectories for foreign version(s) of sources. 
<P>Whether you are creating a new foreign source or updating an existing one, 
the script 'SRCbuilder.pl' can be used to create all of your SRC atoms. Use 
'/usr/tools/src/SRCbuilder.pl -h' for more information on its use.

  are usually 3-character abbreviations which often start with the first letter 
  of the SAB. This naming system is messy and difficult to maintain, and one day

<P>All fields are required unless otherwised noted 
<OL>
  <LI><B>source_atom_id: </B>Sharon keeps track of what number blocks are free. 
  Check with her for starting number or carefully edit the file yourself. The 
  list of assigned numbers and directory paths are maintained in 
  /d1/umls/mgmt/termids. Numbers are unique within the file. 12 digit limit. 
  <LI><B>source: </B>the source abbreviation and year of publication (SAB); The 
  year may not correspond to the Metathesaurus Year, e.g. AOD for Meta99 was 
  really AOD from 1995). This value should appear in 'sources.src'. 20 character 
  limit. 
  <LI><B>termgroup: </B>source/termgroup, e.g. "MSH2000/MH." Try to use already 
  established termgroups (See current MRDOC.RRF) or at least ones that don't 
  conflict (you don't want OT to mean "Obsolete term" in one source and "Other 
  term" in another.) Also referred to as "term type." 40 character limit 
  <LI><B>code: </B>either the source will have its own coding system or UMLS 
  numbers will be assigned (or reused where possible). UMLS assigned number 
  should use 'MTHU000001". If there are separate "unique identifiers" and "tree 
  numbers" within a source, use the "unique identifier" for the code. The "tree 
  number" will be used as the HCD in contexts. 30 character limit. 
  <LI><B>status: </B>usually "N" for needs review. Occasionally, we put things 
  in as "R" (reviewed) so that they don't trigger editing. E.g., if a source 
  introduces a new "abbreviation" termtype, we may put it in as reviewed so it 
  does not cause the entire source to need review. Can be R, U, or N. 
  <LI><B>to_be_released: </B>- usually "Y". The exception is that sometimes 
  atoms are added for editing purposes only and will not actually be released, 
  e.g. the CPT/ABs are not released except as attributes in MRSAT. Valid values 
  are Y, release; N, remove from database; and n, don't release. 
  <LI><B>released: </B>- always "N". Valid values are A - previously released 
  approved; U - previously release unapproved, but you won't see these. 
  <LI><B>atom_name: </B>- the "term." Deciding what is an "atom" may be the most 
  difficult part of source inversion. See <A 
  href="/Inversion/atoms.html">more information on 
  atoms</A> for details. 1200 character limit. 
  <LI><B>suppressible: </B>O/Y/E/M/N. 
  <UL>
    <LI>O - Obsolete content (obsolesced by the source or by us; if

  <LI><B>integrity_vector: </B>leave empty (no space, just ||) 
  <LI><B>make_demotion: </B>Y or N depending on whether the two atoms should 
  absolutely positively end up in the same concept. For example abbreviations 
  and other SFO/LFOs should clearly merge, so they'd get a N. Source-asserted 
  synonymy should definitely be looked at for a second opinion on what they 
  consider SY, so in that case Y. This field isn't actually read by the 
  recipe-runner, however it is important to get the value correct because you 
  will have to answer the "make demotions question" in the recipe-writer, and 
  you should have an answer ready. 
  <LI><B>change_status: </B>Y or N. This only has an effect when the atoms are

<H3><B>Editing Sort order</B></H3>Information about ordering concepts for 
editing worklists was previously found in the worklist sortkey. It is now found 
in the 14th field of the file 'classes_atoms.src'. 
<P>Every source needs a sort order for editing so that when NLM creates 
worklists, the concepts appear in some order that makes sense, e.g. it is easier 
to work through all the concepts related to "heart disease" at the same time, 
rather than skipping around throughout the source; For some sources, the best 
way to sort may be on code (e.g. CPT, where the book is organized by code), 
alphabetical, or semantic type. 
<P>For most sources with contexts, the best way cognitively for editors to work 
through a list of concepts is via the hierarchy. We can leverage the context 
TREEPOS file to create a depth-first ordered list, which we call "worklist 
sortkey" This ordering can be used by the editing management system to order 
concepts within an editing worklist. The order appears in the 14th field of 
'classes_atoms.src', "order_id". 
<P>ALL atoms from the source must have an order_id. If an atom has multiple tree 
positions, NLM will just use the first tree position when they process the atom. 

<P>In many sources, not all atoms have contexts, so they won't all appear in the 
cxt/TREEPOS file. In these cases, you may be able to create a "fake" tree 
postion for sorting purposes. For example, if your source has an "ET" termgroup 
that doesn't get contexts, but it has the same code as the PTs, you can probably 
join the cxt/TREEPOS file back to classes_atoms.src on "code" to get a complete 
sortkey ordering. 
<P>This field can contain anything that will give you the correct sort order. 
Typical values for this field are a "tree position" (e.g. from TREEPOS) or a 
number (if you use a number, make sure they're all the same number of digits, so 
if you do a non-numeric sort they will remain in the correct order. 
<P>The recommended method for sorting should be indicated in the editor notes on 
SIMS/meow.
