<h3>
Overview [10 min]</h3>
MEME4 is the Metathesaurus Enhancement and Maintenance Environment, version 
4, designed to support the automatic and human integration of the medical 
terminologies that comprise the National Library of Medicine's UMLS (Unified 
Medical Language System) Metathesaurus. &nbsp; The system supports the insertion
of new source content and updates to existing source content, manages workflow,
provides integrity and quality assurance services, allows for human editing
and review of the content, and produces the Metathesaurus in its native format.<br>
<br>
The environment consists of a Metathesaurus Information Database (MID), a
java-based application server which provides the editing services, a suite
of tools for building insertion "recipes", and mechanisms to pass changes
to a Metathesaurus Release Database (MRD) from which the Metathesaurus is
produced. &nbsp;Some key characteristics of MEME are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Concept centric</li>
  <li>Underlying relational model</li>
  <li>Layered architecture</li>
  <li>Action based change model with <span style="font-style: italic;">total recall</span></li>
  <li>Configurable data and action integrity constraints</li>
  <li>Client/server architecture</li>
  <li>Language-independent APIs.</li>
</ul>
.<br>
<h3>Architecture [10 min]</h3>
MEME is a comprehensive system comprising a number of different programs
written in a variety of languages. &nbsp;The core of the MEME system is a
Java-based application server that provides services to clients in a language
and operating system independent fashion. &nbsp;The basic architecture of
the application server is captured by this diagram:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/MEME/Documentation/meme_application_server_arch.jpg" alt="" style="width: 716px; height: 345px;" width="716" height="345">
<br>
</div>
&nbsp;<br>
Java and Perl clients are provided for various services like generating concept
reports and performing batch actions. &nbsp;The server<br> 
implements a subset of HTTP/1.1 protocol and resonds to XML documents representing 
serialized service requests. &nbsp;Application developers are encouraged
to write clients in Java since the code for communicating with the server 
is already implemented, so an application developer can focus on working with
objects and program logic and not worry about parsing or network communications.
&nbsp;The current MEME implementation communicates using HTTP, however it
could be changed to employ virtually any network protocol desired (e.g. FTP,
HTTPS, custom, etc.). For more details on the application server architecture,
view the <a href="/MEME/Documentation/meme4_design_document.html">design document</a>.
One guiding principle of MEME4 is that all interactions with the MID and
MRD should be handled through the application server, so that clients are
never responsible for connecting directly to a database. &nbsp;In practice,
we still employ shell scripts and Perl code (such as the matrix initializer)
which manually connect to the database, however eventually MEME will provide
access to ALL services through the server, so any other code will merely
be a client connecting to the server.<br>
<br>
In addition to the application server, there are a variety of shell and perl
scripts that live in the $MEME_HOME/bin directory of a MEME installation,
and a suite of useful on-line utilities (some of which use the application
server) that reside on <a href="/">the web server</a>.<br>
<br>
The database itself (MID or MRD) contain a variety of <a href="/MEME/Documentation/plsql.html">PL/SQL packages</a> which provide certain functions from within the database itself.<br>
<br> The primary change from MEME3 to MEME4 was to port the editing environment 
back and front ends to this Java application server architecture from a OpenROAD 
fat client environment. &nbsp;The perl and csh scripts were repurposed to
work in the new environment but are essentially the same. The MID itself
is also largely unchanged from MEME3 to MEME4.<br>
<h3>Data [15 min]</h3>
The MID has a large number of <a href="/MEME/Training/tables_all.html">tables</a> which can be broken down into essentially four categories:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Core data</li>
  <li>Auxiliary data</li>
  <li>Metadata</li>
  <li>Action logs<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Core data is characterized by the fact that it is manipulated by editors,
that molecular and atomic actions are used to make those changes, and that
it is released to the public in the Metathesaurus (for more details see the <a href="/MEME/Training/glossary.html#core_data">glossary</a>). &nbsp;There are four main tables that comprise the core data, affectionately called CRACS: <span style="font-family: monospace;">classes</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">relationships</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">attributes</span>, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">concept_status</span>.
&nbsp;There are a few other tables that contain core data which are connected
to these four, which exist to offload some of the data volume into other
places, including: <span style="font-family: monospace;">atoms</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">stringtab</span>. &nbsp;Each of the four main core tables has a corresponding <span style="font-style: italic;">dead</span> (e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">dead_attributes</span>) and a corresponding <span style="font-style: italic;">source</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> table (e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">source_attributes</span>). &nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">source</span> tables are staging areas when data is being inserted, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">dead </span>tables
are repositories for "deleted" data (so that deletes can be safely undone).
&nbsp;All changes to core data are preformed by actions and are logged. &nbsp;
<br>
<br> Core tables are also where all of the Metathesaurus unique identifiers
reside, including CUI, LUI, SUI, AUI, RUI, and ATUI. &nbsp;For more on the
semantics of CUI, AUI, RUI, and ATUI <a href="/MEME/Documentation/meta_ui_semantics.html">click here</a>.<br>
<br>
There is one other pseudo-core table <span style="font-family: monospace;">context_relationships</span>
which meets all of the criteria of a core table except that, in practice,
its content is never changed directly by editors (although this will likely
be true in the future).<br>
<br>
Auxiliary data is characterized by the fact that it is manipulated but not
by molecular and atomic actions, and so changes to these tables are logged
in a different fashion. &nbsp;Any data which gets released but which is not
core data is considered auxiliary data. &nbsp;In addition, any data used
to compute things for release purposes (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">safe replacements</span>) but which is not directly released is also considered auxiliary data. &nbsp;There are many auxiliary tables, including: <span style="font-family: monospace;">source_rank</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">sims_info</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">termgroup_rank</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">mom_safe_replacement</span>, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">source_version</span>. &nbsp;Changes to auxiliary data tables should be made by auxiliary data actions.<br>
<br>
Metadata tables are those that track important things about the state of
the database, in particular which tables must exist in the MID, and what
indexing strategy is used for those tables. &nbsp;Examples of metadata tables
are: <span style="font-family: monospace;">meme_tables</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">meme_indexes</span>, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">meme_ind_columns</span>. &nbsp;At some point, <span style="font-family: monospace;">meme_tables</span> will itself track exactly what kind of data each table holds.<br>
<br>
Action logs are all of those tables that track changes to the core and auxiliary data tables, including: <span style="font-family: monospace;">molecular_actions</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">atomic_actions</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">operations_queue</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">meme_work</span>, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">activity_log</span>.<br>

<h3>&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Actions [10 min]</h3>




Actions are the heart and soul of MEME, as it is primarily an editing environment.
&nbsp;Conceptually, there are five kinds of actions employed by the MEME
applications, including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Atomic actions</li>
  <li>Molecular actions</li>
  <li>Batch actions</li>
  <li>Macro actions</li>
  <li>Auxiliary data actions</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Atomic actions</span> are implemented as <a href="/MEME/Documentation/plsql_ma.html">PL/SQL</a>
functions and are employed to make and log row level changes to the core
tables. &nbsp;These kind of actions are never called directly, but instead
are used by the conceptually higher level molecular actions. &nbsp; These
actions are logged in <span style="font-family: monospace;">atomic_actions</span>
and are grouped together by a "molecule id" representing the molecular action
they are part of. &nbsp;There are currently 13 atomic actions, including
"undo" and "redo". &nbsp;Others will be added in the future as more core
data types are added (such as CUI mappings).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Molecular actions</span> are implemented
as Java classes and represent the kinds of editing actions that an editor
would conceptually perform, such as "add an attribute", "approve the concept",
or "merge these two concepts". &nbsp; Molecular actions perform one or more
atomic actions in the background to enact the change desired by the editor.
&nbsp;These actions are logged in <span style="font-family: monospace;">molecular_actions</span>
and can be grouped together by a "transaction id" representing a collection
of related actions (such as the editing activity of a single editor during
one editing interface session). &nbsp;There are currently 16 molecular actions
which support the editing of the four main conceptual core data elements:
concepts, atoms, attributes, and relationships. &nbsp;For more details see
the <a href="/MEME/Documentation/molecular_actions_index.html">Molecular Actions developer guide</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Batch actions</span> are collections of
molecular actions. &nbsp;Batch actions were added to MEME to support batch
operations typically seen during source insertions without causing a huge
drain on performance. &nbsp;A typical batch action would be something like
"Make all UMD2003 atoms unreleasable". Batch actions are driven off of ids
found in tables, files, or comma separated lists (on the command line) and
most often <span style="font-style: italic;">fake</span> a series of molecular
actions by making the requested changes as if molecular actions had and creating
log entries as a molecular action would. &nbsp;All of the "molecular actions"
performed by a batch action will be grouped together under the same transaction_id,
and there will be one molecular action for each atomic action in the log.
&nbsp;Using our example of making all UMD2003 atoms unreleasable, for each
atom in the list, there would be a MOLECULAR_CHANGE_TOBERELEASED action in
the <span style="font-family: monospace;">molecular_actions</span> table and a corresponding row in <span style="font-family: monospace;">atomic_actions</span> responsible for the actual change in tobereleased value to that atom.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
In some instances, (insert and concept approval) batch actions are implemented
as actual &nbsp;calls to the molecular action code driven from the source
table, file. &nbsp; In all cases, batch actions are undoable exactly as molecular
actions are. &nbsp;All batch actions performed together will share the same
transaction id.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Macro actions</span> are collections of
atomic actions all performed as part of a molecular action (these actions
are also known as "macro molecular actions"). &nbsp;Macro actions are an
even more efficient form of a batch action because only a single row in molecular
actions is logged. &nbsp;The primary purpose of these actions is to make
synchronizing of data to the MRD more efficient. &nbsp;Whereas molecular
actions (and hence batch actions) are sent to the MRD one at a time (by a
process scouring the molecular_actions log), macro actions dump entries into
<span style="font-family: monospace;">operations_queue</span> which group
together large numbers of changes in single actions. &nbsp;While the example
of making all UMD2003 atoms unreleasable was used above, such an action would
be much more prudently performed as a macro action. &nbsp; While macro actions
do log their data changes in a different way, they are fully undoable, as
are batch actions, although, undoing them generates another document in the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">operations_queue</span> log.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Auxiliary data actions</span> are used
to log changes to auxiliary data tables. &nbsp;While called actions, they
are really records of actions used to inform the MRD of changes to these
tables in the MID (since regular action logs are not changed). &nbsp;Whenever
an auxiliary data table is changed, the process that changed it should call
the <a href="/MEME/Documentation/plsql_ma.html#report_table_change"><span style="font-family: monospace;">MEME_APROCS.report_table_change</span></a> method to generate an auxiliary data action document which is saved in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">operations_queue </span>table
and applied to the MRD at a later time. &nbsp;It is important to understand
that auxiliary data actions are not directly undoable, but can be undone
by changing the data back to its previous state and calling <a href="/MEME/Documentation/plsql_ma.html#report_table_change"><span style="font-family: monospace;">MEME_APROCS.report_table_change</span></a> again.<br>

<h3>Insertion [10 min]</h3>
Editors add very little actual new data to a MID. &nbsp;Most of the data
enters the system through source insertions. &nbsp;In a typical editing cycle
a small number of new sources will be added to the MID, and a larger number
of updates to existing sources will be processed. &nbsp;When handling an
update to a source, there are two models for managing the change: a <span style="font-style: italic;">full update insertion</span> or a <span style="font-style: italic;">partial update insertion</span>.
&nbsp;If it is possible to compute the total set of things that changed between
the version of a source currently in the MID and the next version, then only
that set of changes can be applied. &nbsp;This is a <span style="font-style: italic;">partial update insertion</span>. &nbsp;Otherwise the full new version must be inserted.<br>
<br>
The insertion process involves a number of steps and feedback loops. &nbsp;The typical process is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Write an insertion recipe (using the <a href="/MIDS/insertion_recipewriter.html">recipe writer</a>). &nbsp;Often, this involves looking at the recipe used to insert the previous version of the source (if it is an update).</li>
  <li>Create an insertion script. &nbsp;The recipe writer should take care of this, but occasionally modifications are needed.</li>
  <li>Upload the files to the test machine. (the src files and the insertion script).</li>
  <li>Send a database request for the test database (typically testsrc-db).</li>
  <li>Run the insertion script, feed back any necessary data to inverters.</li>
  <li>Report test insertion to NLM.</li>
  <li>NLM reviews test insertion, often minor changes are made.</li>
  <li>Fix data/recipe according to the test insertion.</li>
  <li>Schedule the real insertion.</li>
  <li>Send a database request for the real database (typically editing-db)</li>
  <li>Upload the files to the editing machine.</li>
  <li>Run the insertion script.</li>
  <li>Report real insertion to NLM.</li>
  <li>NLM Reviews the real insertion<br>
  </li>
</ol>
For more details on exactly how a source is inserted, see the <a href="/MEME/Training/how_to_insert_a_source.html">How to Insert a Source</a> document.<br>
<br>
Once a source is added, the EMS is used to break it into manageable sections,
and these worklists are assigned to editors. &nbsp;For new sources, the entire
source must be reviewed by humans, for updates, only the part that does not
constitute <span style="font-style: italic;">safe replacement</span> requires
review. &nbsp; Safe replacement is a step in the insertion recipe &nbsp;that
determines a predicate by which certain data elements in an update version
of a source can be identified as "the same thing as in the previous version".
&nbsp;Since the previous version of the source has been edited, it follows
that those data elements that did not change do not require future editing.
&nbsp;Determining the correct safe replacement predicate is difficult, and
involves the advice of content experts for each source involved.<br>

<h3>Production [5 min]</h3>
The MRD (Metathesaurus Release Database) is a historical database which tracks
the releasable states of all Metathesaurus data over time. &nbsp;We also
casually refer to the suite of applications that supports this database as
MRD. &nbsp;The eventual goal of the MRD is that it will be in an <span style="font-style: italic;">always ready</span>
mode, so that at any time a release can be performed (in a short period of
time). &nbsp;Furthermore, since it employs a state based model, it is capable
of producing a release which contains only the changes from one version of
the release to another.<br>
<br>
Currently the Metathesaurus is released four times a year (Winter, Spring,
Summer, and Fall) and these releases are respectively known as AA, AB, AC,
and AD. &nbsp;This two letter version convention indicates that, eventually,
we intend to support more than 26 releases in a given year. &nbsp;A <span style="font-style: italic;">release</span> consists of a set of relational files in the <a href="/MRD/Documentation/rich_release_format.html">Rich Release Format</a>, also known as MR+.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
&nbsp;An update model for the Metathesaurus is being developed to allow us
to produce a set of files which define only the changes since a known previous
release. &nbsp;The reason for this is that the full Metathesaurus distribution
may be 10 GB of data, or more, whereas an update may be as small as 500M
or less.<br>



<h3>Integrities and Quality Assurance [10 min]<br>
</h3>



MEME employs a <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> sophisticated
set of quality assurance suites, and a highly programmable integrity system
that can perform and validate actions in real time. &nbsp;There are three
types of QA and integrity checking that we employ:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Semantic Validation</li>
  <li>Conservation of Mass</li>
  <li>Unit tests<br>
  </li>
</ol>
The life cycle of the Metathesaurus (as seen in <a href="/MIDS/">MIDS</a>)
involves a series of data transformations: from source files to .src files,
from .src files into the database, editing, from MID to the MRD, from MRD,
and finally from MRD to the release files. &nbsp;Each stage of this processing
must undergo QA to validate that unintended data changes did not occur. &nbsp;Usually
this is a combination of semantic validation (checks that look to verify
certain rules have not been violated) and conservation of mass (checks that
verify that the number of things in one state is the same as in another state).<br>
<br>
Transformation from native source files to .src files is handled by an <a href="/Inversion/README.srctools.html">inversion QA suite</a>
that tries to ensure that counts of things in the .src files match the originating
data, and that there are no anomalous conditions (such as a single case of
a particular attribute name).<br>
<br>
Transformation from .src files to the MID (the insertion process) is validated
by the "Monster QA". &nbsp;Just after an insertion, we run a series of queries
to count the data and save the results for comparison at later times. &nbsp;The
idea here is that whatever goes in should stay there unless it is known to
have been removed. &nbsp;We trust SQLLDR and do not currently verify that
the .src file counts match the initial QA counts.<br>
<br>
The editing process has the most intensive QA process of all. &nbsp;Once each week we run the <a href="/cgi-lti-oracle/validate_mid.cgi">MID Validation</a> suite and the <a href="/MEME/Documentation/automated_qa.html">Automated QA</a>.
&nbsp;The first verifies that editors have not created illegal data conditions
by running a series of over 230 queries. &nbsp;Each query has an associated
description and the possibility of performing an automated fix. &nbsp; The
Automated QA compares the current MID counts to those counts generated during
insertion to verify that no data loss has occurred. &nbsp;On a daily basis,
we run the matrix initialize which identifies which concepts require editing
and pre-computes their integrity state for reporting purposes. In addition
to these suites, we also have an on-line integrity system that can stop actions
from creating illegal or undesirable data conditions in the first place.
&nbsp;These are always semantic checks, most often applied to merging, moving,
or splitting (to prevent things like two MSH main headings in the same concept).
&nbsp;In MEME4, the <a href="/javadoc/gov/nih/nlm/meme/integrity/package-summary.html">on-line integrity system</a> is implemented completely in Java.<br>
<br>
The MID to MRD data transformation is validated by the same tools used to
validate editing. &nbsp;First we copy the data to MRD, and then we copy all
of the QA counts from the MID to MRD. &nbsp;We re-run the counts and compare
them to the MID counts before copyout and verify that the counts are the
same. &nbsp;This verifies that the MRD contains exactly the same data as
the MID. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
When the MRD moves data from the core MID tables to the <span style="font-style: italic;">MRD</span> tables (which are the tables which employ a historical state model of all releasable Metathesaurus data, also known as <span style="font-style: italic;">mrd states</span>), we run a version of the MID Validation with queries tailored to validate this transformation.<br>
<br>
Finally, when a release is produced, we employ a very sophisticated set of
QA scripts which validate both the transformation of the data from the database
into the files, but also compare the current release of the data to two prior
releases, so the exact changes can be understood and explained.<br>
<br>
In addition to QA of the data, we have a suite of unit tests that we perform
against the MEME application server before a release to ensure that we have
not re-introduced known bugs from the past.
