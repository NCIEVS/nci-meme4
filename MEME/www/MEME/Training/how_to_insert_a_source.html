How to Insert a Source</h2></center>

<hr><i>Following is a description of the steps involved in inserting a
source.</i>

<td NOSAVE>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>Locate the source files. Typically there will be an alias
as the <tt>umls</tt> user which will get you to the directory above where
the directory is.&nbsp; For sources inserted in 2000, we used the alias
<tt>01</tt>,
for sources inserted in 2001 we used the alias <tt>02</tt>.&nbsp; A similar
naming scheme will be preserved in the future.&nbsp; Once you are at that
directory, the directory containing the source files will have a name matching
the source abbreviation of the source we will be inserting.&nbsp; For example,
the following commands would be used to get to the source files for <tt>MSH2002</tt>.</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>% 02
% cd MSH2002</font></tt></pre>

<li>
<font size=-1>Run the recipe writer.&nbsp; This is done by making a particular
call to a perl script in <tt>$MEME_HOME/bin</tt>.&nbsp; If you are in the
directory containing the <tt>.src</tt> files, you can do this (as the <tt>umls</tt>
user):</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>% recipe.pl -writer -src=. &amp;</font></tt></pre>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Note:</i> the recipe writer requires the presence of a
<tt>termgroups.src</tt>
file and a <tt>mergefacts.src</tt> file (if precomputed merge facts will
be used).</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><i>Note:</i> there are other options available when running
the recipe writer, call it with <tt>-help</tt> for more info.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Write the recipe according to instructions given by the source
inverter.&nbsp; It is often a good idea for update sources to review the
previous year's recipe.&nbsp; All of the HTML recipes can be found in the
directory:&nbsp; <a href="/Sources">/Sources</a>.&nbsp;
The HTML files are given names like <tt>RECIPE.&lt;source abbreviation>.html</tt>,
for example:&nbsp; <tt>RECIPE.msh2001.html</tt>.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Once a recipe is written, use the <i>File</i> menu to save
it.&nbsp; Save the file in the same directory as the <tt>.src</tt> files
with a name like <tt>&lt;source abbreviation>.ser</tt>, for example: <tt>MSH2001.ser</tt>.&nbsp;
Once you have saved the recipe, use the <i>File</i> menu to view the recipe.&nbsp;
This will cause an HTML file to be saved in the same directory as the <tt>.src</tt>
files.&nbsp; This file will be named according to the scheme described
above.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>FTP the recipe HTML file to meow.&nbsp; This is done by connecting
to smis.</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>% ftp smis.nlm.nih.gov</font></tt></pre>
<font size=-1>And then going to the Sources directory.</font>
<pre><tt><font size=-1>% cd ../meow/Sources
% put RECIPE.msh2002.html</font></tt></pre>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b><font size=-1>Write an Insertion Script</font></b></td>

<td><font size=-1>The insertion is actually performed by a <tt>.csh</tt>
script which is created to match the indicated functionality in the recipe.&nbsp;
Shell scripts for all of the sources we have inserted are available in
a single directory: <tt>$MEME_HOME/bin-insert</tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally,
two template scripts exist in this directory: (a) <tt>source.csh</tt> which
is the template script for inserting a new or update source and (b) <tt>insert_foreign.csh</tt>
which is a template script for inserting a foreign language source.&nbsp;
A <a href="/MEME/Training/how_to_script_an_insertion.html">tutorial</a>
is available for how to write a shell script given a recipe.&nbsp; Typically
insertion scripts should be validated by a third party (usually <i>BAC</i>)
before a test insertion is started.</font></td>
</tr>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE><b><font size=-1>Perform a Test Insertion</font></b></td>

<td><font size=-1>For every source, a test insertion is performed to validate
the recipe and the process before changes are made to the real editing
database.&nbsp; Performing a test insertion involves the following steps:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1><b>Send a database request</b>.&nbsp; We should not access
NLM databases unless we first send a request.&nbsp; Requests are sent by
using <a href="/cgi-lti-oracle/db_request.cgi" target="_blank">this
web tool</a>.&nbsp; Select the test database (probably current-testsrc),
select whether or not backups should be enabled, and then write a description
of the work to be performed, something like "Test insertion of MSH2002".</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><b>Create a directory at the NLM</b>.&nbsp; Test insertions
will usually be performed on a machine that is different from the main
editing machine.&nbsp; Currently, test insertions are performed on <i>oc.nlm.nih.gov</i>.&nbsp;
Log on to the test insertion machine and <tt>cd</tt> to the <tt>$MEME_HOME</tt>
directory.&nbsp; There will be a directory under this directory with a
name like <tt>META2002</tt>.&nbsp; Add one to the current year (so if it
is 2001 you get 2002) and <tt>cd</tt> to the directory with that year.&nbsp;
The year is one in advance of this year because we are inserting sources
for the following year's Metathesaurus.&nbsp; At the beginning of the year,
this directory will not exist so you must make it.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><b>FTP the files to the NLM</b>.&nbsp; Find the files locally
(See "Write a Recipe" for instructions on locating source files, or consult
with the person who inverted the source).&nbsp; FTP all of the <tt>.src</tt>
files to the directory created in the prior step.&nbsp; If there are any
contexts for the source, ftp the <tt>.raw2</tt> or <tt>.raw3</tt> files
also.&nbsp; Typically, these files will be found in a subdirectory of the
directory containing the <tt>.src</tt> files called <tt>cxt</tt>.&nbsp;
If no such directory exists, verify that there are no context files by
issuing this command</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>% find . -name "*.raw3"</font></tt></pre>
<font size=-1>If there are files somewhere in the directory structure this
command will tell you where.&nbsp; If you cannot find context files, verify
with the source inverter that the source does not have contexts.

<li>
<font size=-1><b>FTP the insertion script to the NLM</b>.&nbsp; FTP the
script from the "Write an Insertion Script" step to the same directory
as the
<tt>.src</tt> files at NLM.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><b>Run the script</b>.&nbsp; In the future, we will hopefully
have insertion scripts that are ready to run from start to finish without
human intervention, but until that point the script is run by cutting-and-pasting
sections one at a time and verifying that they complete successfully.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1><b>Update the recipe file</b>.&nbsp; Before you start the
insertion, open the recipe file in an HTML editor (probably the easiest
thing is to use <i>Netscape Composer</i>).&nbsp; As you perform various
sections of the recipe (in particular merge steps), update the recipe file
by pasting in the results of the step.&nbsp; For non-merge steps (such
as Load Steps, Resolve STY Steps, etc.) paste in the log that gets printed
to the screen when you run the operation.&nbsp; For example, a <i>safe
replacement</i> section may produce a log like this:</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>[14-aug-2001 19:11:14] transaction_id=2369662
[14-aug-2001 19:13:09] Action MACRO_CHANGE_FIELD successfully completed (1).
[14-aug-2001 19:13:11] count: 0
[14-aug-2001 19:13:12] transaction_id=2369666
[14-aug-2001 19:13:47] Action MOLECULAR_CHANGE_STATUS successfully completed (672).
[14-aug-2001 19:13:47] SAFE_REPLACEMENT successfully completed.</font></tt></pre>
<font size=-1>For merge steps, there are three pieces of information to
put into the recipe.&nbsp; The first is the result of running this query
in the database where the insertion is taking place:</font>
<pre><tt><font size=-1>SQL> select count(*),status from mom_merge_facts group by status;</font></tt></pre>
<font size=-1>This will produce data like the following.</font>
<pre><tt><font size=-1>&nbsp; COUNT(*) S
---------- -
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 332 D
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 54 F
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4095 M
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2790 P</font></tt></pre>
<font size=-1>The flags <i>D</i> and <i>F</i> indicate that a merge failed,
<i>M</i>
indicates that a merge happened, and <i>P</i> indicates that a merge previously
happened.&nbsp; The two other pieces of information to put in the log are
the merge <tt>transaction_id</tt> and demotion <tt>transaction_id</tt>.&nbsp;
These can be found by looking in the file <i>/tmp/package</i> on the machine
where the merge set was just run.&nbsp;</font>
<li>
<font size=-1><b>Final Steps</b>.&nbsp; Once everything in the insertion
script has been run, there are a couple final steps.&nbsp;</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>Make sure the inverter has uploaded the <i>sortkey</i> file
and <i>source information page</i>.&nbsp; The inverter will know what you
mean.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Give the inverter a chance to look at the data before informing
NLM.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Insert any Semantic Type patches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically a
test insertion will involve the creation of a file called <tt>sty_term_ids</tt>
that should be FTP'd back to the Apelon directory containing the <tt>.src</tt>
files.&nbsp; The inverter may use this file to build semantic type defaults.&nbsp;
These defaults will likely appear in a file called <tt>attributes.stys.src</tt>
(they are also added to the <tt>attributes.src</tt> file so that they will
appear in the <i>real</i> insertion).&nbsp; To load this file, FTP it to
the NLM&nbsp;into a subdirectory of where the <tt>.src</tt> files were
put and call it <tt>attributes.src</tt> (for example <tt>/d5/MEME/dev/META2003/MDR41/patch/attributes.src</tt>).&nbsp;
Then, you can use the (local) <tt>$MEME_HOME/Patch/insert_attributes.csh</tt>
script to insert those attributes.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>After that is done, inform the NLM by sending an email that
contains the results of running the report_tables step as well as the location
of the matrixinit.log file.&nbsp; For example, your mail might look like
this:</font></li>

<pre><tt><font size=-1>The LOINC insertion is complete, here are the counts:
[15-aug-2001 14:49:22] 407 rows inserted in table LNC203_demotions
[15-aug-2001 14:49:22] 573 rows inserted in table LNC203_merges
[15-aug-2001 14:49:22] 6620 rows inserted in table LNC203_need_review
[15-aug-2001 14:49:22] 39577 rows inserted in table LNC203_replaced

The matrix init log is in:

oc:/d5/MEME/dev/META2002/LNC203/matrixinit.log</font></tt></pre>
</ul>
</ul>

<td><font size=-1>Same process as test insertion, but performed on the
editing database.&nbsp; Currently, the machine where real insertions take
place is <i>oa.nlm.nih.gov</i>.&nbsp; The current database will be called
oa_mid&lt;year> where &lt;year> is the current year + 1 (so 2002 if the
year is 2001).&nbsp; There are some settings at the top of the insertion
script, one of which is the database name, make sure and set it so you
are using the correct database.&nbsp;&nbsp; While performing the insertion,
overwrite the recipe edits that you made during the test insertion with
data from the real insertion.</font></td>
