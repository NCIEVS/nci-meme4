We looked<br>into allowing this to operate in a headless <br>environment and it simply cannot be done because<br>Swing components are used to render the HTML.<br>Thus, the DISPLAY variable must be set.||10/24|
meme.jar|4|34.2|20031024|Two changes:<br>1. Fix for getConflictingRelationships<br>2. Additional printing parameters allowing<br>   enscript.pl to control the scaling factor<br>   of the document being printed.||10/24|

Please<br>  specify that the JAWS jekyll should require 1.4.2.<br>2. Faster printing.  I believe we solved the outstanding<br>  printing issues.<br>3.

meme.jar|4|51|20050114|Variety of changes and bug fixes mostly focused on <br>tightening the undo and redo mechanisms for the new <br>action model.  Only a few changes here will apply <br>to editors/Jekyll.  Changes include,<br>1. Completion of action model for undoing logged <br>   actions.  Now, every action defines its own inverse <br>   and can be undone by performing the inverse of the <br>   action.  This alleviates the need for an explicit <br>   "undo" action.  To perform a "redo", all you have <br>   to do is get the inverse of the "undo" action.<br>2. Some actions are inherently not undoable and these <br>   return as their inverse an action that performs <br>   no operation.<br>3. CONTEXTS section of the concept report was moved <br>   below RELATIONSHIPS.<br>4. SAB for DEF and SOS attributes will now show up on <br>   concept report.<br>5. A bug that happens when the preferred atom of a <br>   related concept is not set was fixed.<br>6. Improved support for transaction and work identifiers.||01/14|

meme.jar|4|52|20050125|This release was primarily made to addresss the recent<br>recurring network problems.  Now, when a MEME java client<br>experiences a network problem when communicating with the<br>server it tries again to send the request (if it was not<br>sent successfully) and tries again to receive the response<br>(if the request was sent but no response was obtained).<br>A 2 second delay is used between attempts and up to 5 attempts<br>are made.  If failure continues after this, exceptions are <br>thrown as before.  Two new exceptions may be thrown:<br>1. FailedToConnectException (indicates a failure to connect<br>   to the server, meaning try again later)<br>2. UnknownStateException (indicates that the server received<br>   a request but the client after 5 attempts was unable to<br>   receive the response.  we do not know in this state whether<br>   or not the request was processed successfully).<br><br>A fix was also made to the recent "fetch out of sequence" error.||01/25|
MEME_OPERATIONS.sql|4|12|20050125|Full-DB CUI assignment algorithm updated to match MEME4 <br>algorithm.||01/25|
