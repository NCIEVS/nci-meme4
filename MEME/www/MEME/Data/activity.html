<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <pre>We are working on finishing up the final QA run.  The database is slow so it is taking a <br>while for everything to complete.  So far it looks good.  We ran CUI assignment and the <br>related processes.  We should be ready to do the copyout tomorrow.<br><br>Here is the plan:<br>1. I will check tomorrow morning (around 10AM EDT) to verify that the QA is clean.<br>   If it looks good, I will send mail to Vlad/Dwayne.<br><br>2. The export of MID, MIDI tablespaces will start.  As soon as a copy of the data from <br>oa_mid2005 has been made, we can be informed.  It is not necessary for us to wait for <br>the copy-in to be completed before starting the insertion in oa_mid2005.  WE just need <br>to make sure that a copy of the clean state was made to be loaded into mrd, oc_testsw, <br>oc_testsrc, and oc_testmisc (the loads into oc databases can even be made early next <br>week instead of this weekend).<br><br>3. As soon as we are informed, the SNOMEDCT obsolete insertion into oa_mid2005 will begin. <br><br>4. As soon as we are informed that MID and MIDI tablespaces have been loaded into MRD, we will begin production.<br><br>Expect a mail around 10:30 AM EDT tomorrow regarding the start of the copyout..<br></pre></div>
