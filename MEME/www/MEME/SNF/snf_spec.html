<h3>Semantic Normal Form Model and Proposal</h3>
<div align="Left">
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h3>Overview</h3>
    It is estimated that there are over 80,000 concepts in the Metathesaurus
  that can be considered <i>clinical drugs</i>. &nbsp;Given that the FDA
only   approves some 10,000 drugs for use, one can conclude that clinical
drug missed  synonymy is prevalent in the Metathesaurus. &nbsp;One approach
to solving  this problems is to create algorithms and processes for normalizing
drug names so that missed synonymy can be found by using the traditional
lexical matching methods. &nbsp;An additional benefit of this approach is
that it presents a model to the user community for how this kind of information
can be represented in a more structured and usable way, which eventually
could lead to improvements in the underlying source vocabularies.<br>
<h3>Goal</h3>
    To overcome the problems associated with disparate naming conventions 
(or  lack of conventions) for clinical drugs in the Metathesaurus' component
 sources  there are five goals which will need to be met.<br>
<ol>
  <li>First, we must specify a <i>Semantic Normal Form Model</i> which will
  indicate how the various pieces of data will be represented in the MID
and   in the Metathesaurus.<br>
  </li>
  <li>We must create a <i>Semantic Normal Form (SNF) </i>for every instance
  of a clinical drug atom in the Metathesaurus. &nbsp;This normal form will
  actually take the form of a <i>graph</i> that connects the clinical drug
 atom to a semantic normal form of that clinical drug. &nbsp;The normalized
 drug name will then be connected to normalized <i>component</i> atoms and
 a normalized     <i>dose form</i> atom. &nbsp;Each of the normalized <i>
component</i>    atoms will then be connected to <i>ingredient</i> atoms.
&nbsp;These data   structures will be created both through batch inversion
processes, and manual   insertion of normal forms where the inversion processes
fail.</li>
  <li>Each normal form created in the previous step will be manually reviewed
  by a human before it is released (by using the <i>Semantic Normal Form
Editor</i>    ).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Next, we will apply our matching and merging machinery to identify
 and correct cases of missed synonymy based on matching normal forms in distinct
  CUIs. &nbsp;Since not all semantic normal forms are synonymous with the
clinical  drugs to which they are connected, we can additionally apply more
sophisticated  matching algorithms (such as finding all cases of clinical
drugs connected  to SNF atoms that share the same component list, which could
find missed synonymy between clinical drugs that have an <i>inverse isa</i>
  relationship to their respective normal forms).</li>
  <li>Finally, we must formalize the update model for these normal forms
 to ensure that updates to drug sources can benefit from the normalization
  work performed in the past. &nbsp;That is to say that for every <i>safe
replacement</i>    atom from an update source, we must ensure that the new
version atom is  connected to the same <i>SNF Graph</i> as the old version
atom; &nbsp;this  will ensure that prior inversion and editing efforts were
not in vain. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Background</h3>
    The first effort to create SNFs was the inversion of VANDF01 in late
2001.   &nbsp;As stated above, a <i>SNF</i> actually takes the form of a
graph with   several layers of atoms connected by a structured set of relationships.
&nbsp;At  the top of the graph is a <i>clinical drug</i> atom which is an
actual named  atom in the VANDF terminology. &nbsp;This atom is connected
to a normalized  form of the name, the <i>SNF</i>,&nbsp; that consists of
a slash (/) separated  list of component names followed by an HL7 dose form.
&nbsp;The <i>SNF</i>    is then connected to one or more <i>component </i>
 atoms that consist of  an ingredient name followed by strength and unit
information. &nbsp;The <i>  component</i> atoms are connected to the <i>SNF</i>
 by <i> constitutes</i>    relationships, and the atom representing the HL7
dose form is connected  to the <i>SNF</i> atom by a <i>dose_form_of</i> relationship.
&nbsp;For each  <i>component</i> atom, there is at least one <i>ingredient</i>
  atom that indicates the <i>active</i> ingredient of the component. &nbsp;There
 may be an additional <i>ingredient</i> atom that indicates the <i>precise
 </i> ingredient of the component. &nbsp;These <i>ingredient</i> atoms are
 connected to the <i>component</i>  atoms by <i>ingredient_of</i> relationships.
 &nbsp;The figure below diagrams these atoms and their respective relationships.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>

<br>
<tt><b><br>
    FIGURE 1</b></tt><br>
<div align="Left">&nbsp;<br>
    In this model, all atoms in the graph are owned by the source (VANDF01),
  except for the dose form which is owned by HL7, and all of the atoms are
 <i> releasable</i>, which is to say that they can be found in the 2002AA
MRCON/MRSO.  &nbsp;The <i>SNF</i> atoms are given a term type of <i>SCD </i>
 (<i>SNF Clinical  Drug</i>), the <i>component </i>atoms are given a term
type of <i>SCDC </i>  (<i>SCD Component</i>), and the <i>ingredient</i> atoms
are given a term  type of &nbsp;<i>IN</i> (<i>INgredient</i>). &nbsp;The
<i>SCD</i> , <i>SCDC</i> , and <i>IN</i> atoms were all algorithmically generated
and subjected to human review before insertion, but the graphs were not directly
 edited in the <i>MID</i>.<br>
<br>
   The inversion of the <i>SNF</i> graphs for VANDF was important for several 
 reasons: it proposed a model for how to represent normalized drug information 
 in the <i>MID</i>, it normalized the dose forms by using a standard terminology, 
 and it facilitated the development of sophisticated algorithms for automatically 
 generating normalized forms of potentially very ugly drug names. &nbsp;However, 
 the human review of VANDF in the <i>MID</i> exposed problems in the algorithmic 
 approach to creating normalized forms and revealed the need for direct human 
 editing of the <i>SNF</i> graphs in the <i>MID</i>. &nbsp;Additionally, the
 model of attributing the <i>SNF</i> graph's atoms and relationships to a
particular source (such as VANDF) creates a number of problems when we consider
that all drug sources should be inverted to make use of SNF data. &nbsp;In
particular, we would have mass duplication of all <i>SCD</i>, <i> SCDC</i>
 , and <i>IN</i>  atoms in MRSO because there would be multiple copies of
the same row with different source values and we would have mass duplication 
of the relationships that connect the graph in MRREL for the same reason.<br>
<h3>Proposed Model</h3>
   Some changes need to be made to the VANDF model to make the best, most 
efficient  use of the <i>SNF</i> as well as to allow direct editing of the 
graph in the <i>MID</i>. &nbsp;In particular, there are four areas that must 
be addressed:<br>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#inversion">Inversion Model</a>
. What is the nature of the inversion time <i>SNF graph</i> for a drug  source?
&nbsp;In particular, what sources are the various pieces attributed  to,
how are <i>precise</i> vs. <i>active</i> ingredients represented, how  are
ingredients represented for a source that does not natively name ingredients?<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#editing">Editing Model</a>
. What is the nature of the <i>SNF graph</i> editing? In particular, what
are the editing operations, what effects do the editing operations have on
the data, how is the duplication of <i>(SCD</i>, <i>SCDC</i>, and <i>IN</i>
   ) atoms constrained, and how does editing affect the release view of the 
 graph?</li>
  <li><a href="post_editing">Post Editing Model</a>
. What post editing tasks, such as matching and merging, need to be performed 
 and how are these processes managed?<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#update">Update Model</a>
. When a drug source is updated, how is it inverted/inserted to best preserve
previous editing work?</li>
</ol>
   The following subsections attempt to address the questions raised above.<br>
<h4><a name="inversion"></a>
Inversion Model</h4>
   The model used to invert the <i>SNF graphs</i> for VANDF is a good starting 
 point. &nbsp;It needs to be expanded to capture the complexity that arises 
 when more sources are thrown into the mix. &nbsp;Following are the variables 
 that the model must account for:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>The SAB of the SCD and SCDC atoms</b>. &nbsp;At inversion time these 
 will belong to the source in question, such as VANDF01.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the relationships in the graph</b>. &nbsp;At inversion 
 time these will belong to the source in question, such as VANDF01.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the dose form atom</b>. &nbsp;This will be an HL7/DF.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the IN atoms</b>.&nbsp;At inversion time these will belong 
 to the source in question, such as VANDF01.</li>
  <li><b>The releasability of the SCD, SCDC, and IN atoms</b>. &nbsp;The SCD
and SCDC atoms will always be inserted as unreleasable (<tt>tobereleased='n'</tt>
   ). &nbsp;The IN atoms will be marked as releasable (<tt>tobereleased='y'</tt>
   ) if they are legitimate atoms from the source and will be marked as unreleasable 
 otherwise. &nbsp;So, a source like MMX may contain clinical drugs that include 
 ingredients that are not explicitly named in MMX itself. &nbsp;In this case, 
 IN atoms attributed to MMX will be inverted but as unreleasable atoms. &nbsp;If 
 the ingredient <i>is</i> explicitly named in MMX, then it will be inserted 
 as a releasable IN atom attributed to MMX.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the CD to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;There 
 are four possibilities for describing this relationship.          
    <ol>
      <li>If the atoms are synonymous, they should be connected by an SFO/LFO 
 relationship with a null RELA.</li>
      <li>If the atoms are synonymous and the CD is the trade name they should
be connected by an SY <i>tradename_of</i> relationship.</li>
      <li>If the SCD atom includes a dose form and the CD atom does not explicitly 
 indicate a dose form, they should be connected by an NT <i>isa</i> relationship.</li>
      <li>If the relationship is of another type, they should be connected 
 by an RT <i>mapped_to</i> relationship.       </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the SCDC to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;This 
 will be <i>constitutes</i>. &nbsp;One or more SCDC atoms may be connected 
 to an SCD for this type of relationship.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the IN to SCDC relationships</b>. &nbsp;For things
considered <i>active</i> ingredients, the value will be <i>active_ingredient_of</i>
    and for things considered <i>precise</i> ingredients, the value will
be      <i>precise_ingredient_of</i>. &nbsp;Each SCDC is allowed one <i>active</i>
    and one <i>precise</i> ingredient. &nbsp;The <i>active</i> ingredient 
is  required, but the <i>precise</i> ingredient is not.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the DF to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;This will
be <i>has_dose_form.</i></li>
</ul>
 The figure below shows a modified inversion diagram to represent the VANDF 
example from above under this new model.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<div align="Center"><img src="vandf01-fix.gif" alt="Revised VANDF Data Structure" width="657" height="470">
<br>
<tt><b>FIGURE 2</b></tt><br>
</div>
 &nbsp;<br>
 There are two main changes to this diagram. &nbsp;First, it indicates that 
the HL7/DF atoms are not part of the inversion, this is because they have 
already been inserted, future inversions should use the existing atoms from 
the <i>MID</i> and create relationships from the newly inverted SCD atoms 
to the existing HL7/DF atoms. &nbsp;Second, the SCD and SCDC atoms are marked 
as unreleasable. &nbsp;If the ingredient atoms were not native to VANDF, they
would also be marked as unreleasable. &nbsp;All atoms in the inversion are
attributed to the source, VANDF, as well as all of the relationships.<br>
<h4><a name="editing"></a>
Editing Model</h4>
Every <i>new SNF graph</i> must be explicitly reviewed by an editor to determine 
if the SCD accompanying the <i>clinical drug</i> atom from a given drug source 
is actually a correct normalized form of the atom. &nbsp;In practice, this 
means an editor will manipulate various parts of this graph to ensure that 
the final product accurately represents the meaning of the <i>clinical drug</i>
 . &nbsp;The graphs that result from editing operations employ a different
model than the one used for inversion to correct problems associated with
duplication of SCDC atoms and misattribution of atoms to a source. &nbsp;Following
is a description of how the editing model handles the variables.<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>The SAB of the SCD and SCDC atoms</b>. &nbsp;Once editing actions
are <i>approved</i>, these atoms will be attributed to NLM02.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the relationships in the graph</b>. &nbsp;Once editing
actions are <i>approved</i>, these atoms will be attributed to NLM02.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the dose form atom</b>. &nbsp;This will be an HL7/DF.</li>
  <li><b>The SAB of the IN atoms</b>. If there are matching ingredient atoms
native to the source, they will belong to the source. &nbsp;If not, we will
use MeSH ingredients present in the <i>MID</i>. &nbsp;If no matching MeSH
ingredients can be found, we will create new NLM02/IN atoms.</li>
  <li><b>The releasability of the SCD, SCDC, and IN atoms</b>. &nbsp;Once
editing actions are <i>approved</i>, all of these atoms will be releasable
.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the CD to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;The same
four possibilities as before are available here:.          
    <ol>
      <li>If the atoms are synonymous, they should be connected by an SFO/LFO 
 relationship with a null RELA.</li>
      <li>If the atoms are synonymous and the CD is the trade name they should
be connected by an SY <i>tradename_of</i> relationship.</li>
      <li>If the SCD atom includes a dose form and the CD atom does not explicitly 
 indicate a dose form, they should be connected by an NT <i>isa</i> relationship.</li>
      <li>If the relationship is of another type, they should be connected 
 by an RT <i>mapped_to</i> relationship.       </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the SCDC to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;This 
 will be <i>constitutes</i>. &nbsp;One or more SCDC atoms may be connected 
 to an SCD for this type of relationship.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the IN to SCDC relationships</b>. &nbsp;For things
considered <i>active</i> ingredients, the value will be <i>active_ingredient_of</i>
    and for things considered <i>precise</i> ingredients, the value will
be      <i>precise_ingredient_of</i>. &nbsp;Each SCDC is allowed one <i>active</i>
    and one <i>precise</i> ingredient. &nbsp;The <i>active</i> ingredient 
is  required, but the <i>precise</i> ingredient is not.</li>
  <li><b>The RELA values for the DF to SCD relationships</b>. &nbsp;This will
be <i>has_dose_form.</i></li>
</ul>
