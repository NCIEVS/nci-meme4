<b>Checklist of what needs to be done during Source Insertions:</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1. If Apelon sends a database request for any kind of source insertion,
we need to completely cutoff editor access to the editing database. This
includes:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>1. Editing to the editing database (cbioapp513.nci.nih.gov_memedb) needs to be
cutoff. This can be done off the EMS page and a link called " Editing Cutoff".
<p>2. Turn off access to the EMS and WMS. There is a link on both the EMS
and WMS page to close access to these pages. The link is on the left side
of the page and is called "Access Control".</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Change the database that the editing interface and Meow
point to. This should be the Browse database. If the database is only down
for one night, then this database does not need to be current. If the planned
insertion will take days or be performed over the weekend, the Browse database
MUST&nbsp;be refreshed to as current as possible.
<br>*Important - Make sure editing is also cutoff on the Browse database.
Editors should not have access to make changes to this database.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. If this is a big insertion, like a UMLS update, we need to make sure
we have a current copy of the editing database to go back to if there is
a problem with the insertion.
<p>5. A message needs to be sent to meme_editors to let them know the database
will be down and approximately for how long.</blockquote>

<p><br>2. If Apelon sends a request for minor database work, editing does
not need to be cutoff if the work is being done 6:30 pm east coast time
or later.
<p>3. If Apelon sends a request for MAJOR database work (this would include
lots of changing of data), then the same procedure for cutting off editing
for a source insertion should be followed.
<p>Apelon should NOT&nbsp;be given permission to do any work if no one
is around to cutoff editing, switch databases, alert the editors, etc.
