<LI>The first rule is to always <STRONG>respect the source</STRONG>.
Therefore:
<UL>
<LI>Don't merge MSH atoms with different MeSH UIs (D#, C#, Q#) together across
the same MeSH year.  This rule applies to all MeSH atoms and not just MHs. The
exceptions to this are:
<PRE>MeSH GQ (geographic qualifier) terms may be merged with other atoms, 
including MeSH Main Headings 
(e.g. Brazil [MSH99/MH/D001938] may be merged with Brazil [MSH99/GQ/Q000104], 
Brazil [CSP98/PT/1266-1044], 
and Brazil [RCD98/PT/Ua08y])

<BR>MeSH LQ terms (language qualifiers) may be merged with other MeSH terms 
and non-MeSH terms.
</PRE></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI> MeSH relationships (NRW, BRD, REL, and EQV) are to be respected by
editors.  This includes relationships between an entry term (EP, EN) and the
Main Heading. If an editor disagrees with the relationship, a message should be
sent to meshsugg@nlm.nih.gov outlining the disagreement
and including all relevant identifying information (editors need to provide the
name of the MeSH Heading, Qualifier, or Chemical and the UI (D#, Q#, or C#) in
the subject line).</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>If an editor disagrees with a MeSH STY(s), the change can be made in the
editing database. The editor is then obligated to send a message to
meshsugg@nlm.nih.gov describing the change. Again, sufficient information should
be provided in order to identify the record.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>MeSH Information
<UL>
<LI>Entry Terms - MeSH has two types of entry terms (EN, EP) that will have the
same code as the corresponding main heading (MH). These entry terms can have
different relationships. Some may be synonymous with the MH and should be
merged. Entry terms can also be NRW and BRD than the main heading. In that case,
they should not be merged with the MH. Entry terms can also be synonymous with
each other and can be merged with each other (within the same code). The IMN is
a good place to find information on entry term relationships. The IMN appears on
the concept report and can be read from the Concept screen on the editing
interface. </LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Permuted terms - Permuted terms are generated by the MeSH software and are
permutations or lexical variants of the MH, or one of it's entry terms.  Since
permuted terms are derived from the MH or entry terms already in MeSH, they
should never be in a concept without another MeSH atom that corresponds to the
permuted term. PMs may be merged with other entry terms and MeSH main headings
(within the same code).</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>IMN -The IMN is the Internal MeSH note and is written by MeSH staff. As
mentioned above, it can give information about relationships between entry
terms, etc. It appears on the concept reports and on the editing interface (from
Concept screen). An IMN message of &quot;No=&quot; means that the MeSH
specialist felt that none of the entry terms that were not equivalent to the
MeSH heading were equivalent to each other EXCEPT in obvious cases. 
There is also other information in the IMNs that the MeSH staff uses or has used
in the past for other purposes.  If there is no IMN information about the entry
terms, you should not make assumptions about what that may or may not mean.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>HTs - These are MeSH hierarchical terms. Generally, these atoms are by
themselves in a concept since they represent top levels of the MeSH hierarchy.
There may be equivalent top level hierarchical terms in CRISP. If so, they can
be merged together.  For example:
<PRE>CN# 288337  Diseases (MeSH Category)
CUI C0012674	Concept Status needs Review
STY Classification   R
SCT noun/noun phrase
DEF [Do not release]
  CSP94/PT|previously DISEASES (SEE ALSO SPECIFIC SYSTEMS) -- tree section heading for all specific disorders and diseases.
DEF [Do not release]
  CSP98/PT|tree section heading for all specific disorders and diseases.
ATOMS
             R []  Diseases (MeSH Category) [MSH99/HT/U000006] 
             R         {Diseases (MeSH Category) [MSH98/HT/U000006]} 
             R []  disorder /disease [CSP98/PT/0944-4756] 
             R         {disorder /disease [CSP94/PT/0944-4756]} </PRE></LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI> Qualifiers - Qualifiers are sometimes referred to as subheadings.
Subheadings in MeSH are concepts that are used to further describe a particular
aspect of a MeSH heading. For example, an article discussing changes and
progress in family planning would be indexed: Family Planning/trends. In this
case, &quot;Family Planning&quot; is a MeSH MH and &quot;trends&quot; is a
subheading.   <BR>The XQ is the preferred term for the qualifiers (analogous to
the MH). The TQ's are the entry terms for the qualifier. Qualifiers are not
necessarily adjectival. These terms may be merged with terms from other sources
(even if the terms are not considered qualifiers in the other sources) as long
as there is no analogous MeSH main heading.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Hierarchical information, Scope Notes, Definitions - As with all sources,
information such as the hierarchy and definitions ONLY appear in concepts with
the preferred term  from the source and not with any related or entry terms from
the source. MeSH hierarchical information , Scope Notes, and Definitions are 
presented with the main heading. They never appear with the entry terms or
permuted terms.</LI></UL><BR>
