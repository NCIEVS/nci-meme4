<H1>Relationships in the Metathesaurus</H1></CENTER>
<H3>1. Sources of relationships</H3>
<P>Relationships between strings, terms, and concepts (<A
HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/META3.HTML#s31">see Section 3.1 of
the UMLS Documentation</A>) in the Metathesaurus are (1) derived from source
vocabularies or (2) added during Metathesaurus construction. In general,
Metathesaurus editors (hereafter referred to as editors) clarify ambiguous
relationships taken from source vocabularies (e.g., specify the exact
relationship between an entry term and a preferred term), but may not otherwise
change or delete relationships derived from source vocabularies. This ensures
that the Metathesaurus accurately represents the content of its sources.
<BR>
<BR>In most cases, editors are the authority for the relationships that were
created during Metathesaurus construction. They may add, delete, or change any
relationship that was introduced during Metathesaurus construction, subject of
course to the review and sign-off procedures implemented to insure quality and
consistency in Metathesaurus editing. 
</P>
<H3>2. Reason for Adding Relationships to the Metathesaurus</H3>
<P>Editors add relationships to the Metathesaurus in order to link identical or
closely related concepts from different source vocabularies. Such links are
essential to the UMLS goal of assisting the automated retrieval of related
information from disparate sources that use different vocabularies. In general,
the objective is to have one link from each Metathesaurus source vocabulary to
each concept in the Metathesaurus that is present in that vocabulary or is
similar along some dimension to another concept in that vocabulary.
<BR>
<BR>Since the Metathesaurus is not intended to be a comprehensive biomedical
knowledge base, editors do NOT make specific links between dissimilar concepts
that have important functional relationships, e.g., AIDS and AZT. Such links
will appear in the Metathesaurus only if they are present in one or more of its
source vocabularies or as co-occurrence relationships derived from information
sources such as MEDLINE. 
</P>
<H3>3. Synonymous Relationships</H3>
<P>Given the purpose of the UMLS, the most important relationship to identify
and to record in the Metathesaurus is a <STRONG>synonymous relationship</STRONG>
between strings in the same vocabulary or in different vocabulary sources. To
allow more intelligible user displays and to reduce the number of specific
inter-string relationships that must be recorded and maintained, the
Metathesaurus divides synonymous relationships into two categories: lexical
variation (linking strings that vary only in singular/plural form,
direct/indirect form, punctuation, etc.) and synonymy between unlike strings. In
the Metathesaurus, acronyms are treated as synonyms of the full forms to which
they refer and not as lexical variants.
<BR> 
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Lexical Variation In the Metathesaurus</B></LI></UL>
<P>Lexical variants are determined and labeled by a computer algorithm
supplemented by a set of known exceptions. Editors' only responsibilities
related to lexical variants are (1) to identify when strings that have been
linked as lexical variants have different meanings and to break the synonymous
relationship between them and (2) to report cases when the lexical variation
algorithm produces obviously anomalous results so the algorithm and/or the set
of known exceptions can be adjusted. Editors use the hierarchical contexts and
definitions or scope notes (if present) in different source vocabularies to
determine whether lexical variants from different sources have the same meaning.
  
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Synonymy between Unlike Strings</B></LI></UL>
<P>Some vocabulary sources, e.g., MeSH, include explicitly labeled synonymous
relationships between dissimilar strings. Such relationships are used by the
automated routines that construct preliminary Metathesaurus entries to detect
candidate synonymous relationships between strings in other vocabularies, e.g.,
if vocabulary A indicates that string X = string Y, this relationship is used to
suggest that string X in vocabulary B = string Y in vocabulary C. In reviewing
such relationships the editors' job is to determine whether the meanings of
strings X and Y in vocabularies A, B, and C are indeed equivalent, using the
same clues (contexts, definitions, scope notes) used to detect differences in
meaning between lexical variants.
<BR>
<BR> In a number of vocabularies, the relationship between an &quot;entry term&quot;
and the &quot;preferred term&quot; to which it points is not specifically
labeled. When such vocabularies are incorporated into the Metathesaurus, entry
terms that are lexical variants may be labeled automatically, but editor
intervention will usually be needed to determine whether other entry terms are
synonyms of their preferred terms or mean something different. If there are
multiple entry terms that are not synonyms of the preferred term to which they
point, it is also necessary to determine whether they are synonyms of each
other. The labeling of entry term relationships may occur before these terms are
incorporated into the Metathesaurus and may be assigned to editors as a special
task.
<BR>
<BR>Although editors do determine synonymy between strings in the same source
in the case described above, a more usual task is mapping between concepts in
two source vocabularies or between concepts in a newly incorporated source and
concepts already present in the Metathesaurus. In all cases when editors attempt
to identify synonymy, they must use knowledge of the structure and semantics of
the different vocabularies involved, understanding of the meaning of the
concepts to be mapped, as well as automated tools provided to search the
contents of different vocabularies to direct their search for synonymous or
closely related strings.
<BR>
<BR>Deciding whether two strings are synonyms can be a difficult task.
Unfortunately there are no fool-proof rules to apply. Some general principles
(which contain contradictory elements) follow:
<BR> 
</P>
<P>a. If two strings have different meanings within a single vocabulary source,
they generally cannot be linked as synonyms in the Metathesaurus. The few
exceptions to this rule occur when another more current or biomedically correct
source indicates that they are synonymous.
<BR>
<BR>b. If a slight distinction in meaning between two strings is biomedically
significant, the two strings should not be labelled as synonyms in the
Metathesaurus, even if they are used synonymously in some environments. Examples
of strings that are sometimes used interchangeably, but have biomedically
significant distinctions in meaning are: Neoplasms, Cancer or Malignant
Neoplasms; High Blood Pressure, Hypertension.
<BR>
<BR>c. Making very fine and biomedically insignificant distinctions in meaning
between strings in the Metathesaurus actually works against the goals of the
UMLS.
<BR>
<BR>d. There are some particular synonymy issues that apply only to chemical
concepts. Some specific guidelines are: 
</P>
<P>1) Often the singular and plural of chemical names are not synonyms, because
the plural denotes a group of chemicals and the singular is a specific member of
the group. In these cases, the singular is has a &quot;narrower than&quot;
relationship to the class. The singular and plural are synonymous lexical
variants only when there is no member/class relationship between them.
<BR>
<BR>2) A tradename for a chemical product is considered to be a synonym for the
generic name of its active ingredient, even though the product also contains
fillers and dyes.
<BR>
<BR>3) An N1 name for a chemical almost always has the same meaning as the MeSH
main heading for the chemical. (It may be identical, a lexical variant, or a
synonym.)</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>4. Non-Synonymous Relationships</H3>
<P><BR>Concepts appearing in one Metathesaurus source vocabulary may have no
equivalent in all or some of the other vocabularies represented in the
Metathesaurus. If no synonymous relationship exists, it is useful to link
concepts from one vocabulary to non-synonymous, but closely related concepts in
other vocabularies - - again in support of the UMLS goal of enabling automated
retrieval of related information from disparate sources.
<BR>
<BR>This section will discuss the relationships (BRD, NRW, REL, LIKE) and the
relationship attributes/RelAs (has_part; contains; derivative_of etc.) 
Currently, editors are not responsible for assigning the RelAs to concepts in
the metathesaurus. There will probably be some projects in the future to expand
the list of RelAs and to assign these to concepts in the Metathesaurus. </P>
<P><BR><B>Order of Precedence of Non-Synonymous Relationships</B>
<BR>
<BR>In general, editors attempt to establish the most useful relationship
between a concept in one vocabulary and the available concepts in another
vocabulary and then move on to the next concept. In other words, once a
high-precedence relationship exists, editors should not spend time adding other,
lower precedence relationships.  
<BR>As stated previously, synonymy is the most important relationship to make
between strings in the Metathesaurus. The next most useful relationship is the
Broader Than (BRD) or Narrower Than relationship (NRW). One is the inverse of
the other. Editors need only specify the relationship in one direction. The
inverse relationship is recorded automatically. For the purposes of
Metathesaurus editing, the definition of Broader Than and Narrower Than is as
follows:

<P>*These apply to chemicals/elements and are not currently part of the
Semantic  Network.<BR></P>
<P>All other non-synonymous relationships between concepts fall into the &quot;Other&quot;
category in the Metathesaurus. Within this broad designation, however, there are
some types of relationships that are more likely to contribute to the overall
UMLS goals than others. There are also some types of &quot;other&quot;
relationships that usually should NOT be specified.
<BR>
<BR><B>a. First Priority &quot;Other&quot; Relationships</B>
<BR>
<BR>After the Broader Than/Narrower Than relationship, the next most important
relationships involve close physical proximity or strong similarity or
association. These relationships include:

<P><BR> physically_related_to<BR> contains<BR> surrounds

<B></B>
<BR><BR><B>b.  Second Priority &quot;Other&quot; Relationships</B>
<BR>
<BR>Editors will make connections between concepts that have these
relationships (or in some cases their inverses) less frequently because the
relationships usually link dissimilar concepts that have a functional or
temporal relationship. In some cases, however, connecting concepts that have
these relationships will serve the UMLS goal of supporting retrieval of
disparate, but related information from different sources.

<BR>Exceptions can be made, but should be very infrequent.<BR><BR>
<B>XR relationships</B><BR><BR>The relationship Not Related (XR) is not
released in published version of the Metathesaurus. The primary purpose of XR
relationships is to prevent editors from having to repeatedly review concepts
that have similar atom names but do not mean the same thing. An XR relationship
indicates that these concepts should not be merged. An XR relationship can also
be used if concepts are merged together and then split apart because the
concepts do not belong together and are not related.<BR><BR>XR relationships
should never be created between concepts just to indicate a Not Related
relationship (ex. Fish is obviously not related to Pharmacist so there is no
need to created an XR.) XRs may be used when splitting apart atoms or to change
existing relationships that are wrong. <BR>
<BR><B>LIK</B>
<BR>
<BR>The LIK relationship always appears in the unreviewed/unapproved field of a
concept. MeSH Supplementary Chemicals and a number of SNMI97 concepts currently
are assigned this relationship. <BR><BR>Supplementary Chemical concepts that
are not merged with atoms from other sources are not to be edited at this time<BR>
<BR><B>General Principles Regarding Non-Synonymous Relationships Created by
Editors</B>
<BR>
<BR>a.) When an editor is assigned the task of mapping between vocabularies
within the Metathesaurus the focus is on making <STRONG>one</STRONG> or a very
few of the best possible links. <BR>
<BR>b.) A valid connection between two source vocabularies is generally better
than no connection, even if it isn't the best possible connection.
<BR>
<BR>c.) At this stage in Metathesaurus construction it is more important to add
new connections, to delete obviously incorrect relationships, and to relabel
obviously mislabeled relationships, than it is to ensure consistency in the
types and number of connections made from concept to concept.
<BR>
<BR>d.) When making a new connection to a hierarchical source vocabulary
connect only at the most closely related level of the hierarchy. (e.g., do not
connect a child in one vocabulary to both its parent and its grandparent in
another vocabulary). Looking at the hierarchical context of the term to which
the connection is to be made will obviously help the editor to find the
appropriate level for the link.
<BR>
<BR>e.) While the &quot;typical&quot; case should be one good connection from a
concept to a particular source vocabulary, there will be a number of exceptions.
Some of the common exceptions occur when: 
</P>
<P>1) it requires a combination of terms in one vocabulary to represent a
concept represented by a single term in another vocabulary. Such a combination
of terms is entered in the &quot;Associated Expression&quot; element of a
Metathesaurus entry. In general, all preferred terms in the Associated
Expression will also be linked as related terms. In many cases, one term in the
expression will have a Broader Than/Narrower Than relationship to the concept
and another term with have an &quot;Other&quot; relationship.
<BR>
<BR>2) several concepts in one vocabulary have a Narrower than relationship to
a single concept in another vocabulary. This is likely when the first vocabulary
does not have hierarchical grouping terms that are comparable to the level of
specificity present in the second vocabulary.<BR><BR>  f.) When an editor is
reviewing candidate &quot;other&quot; relationships as part of editing an entire
concept, the focus should be on deleting or relabeling obviously incorrect
relationships and elevating to reviewed status a limited number of the most
closely related unreviewed related terms.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Editors must remember that they may not change or delete a relationship
obtained from a source vocabulary, except in the rare case of source conflicts
regarding synonymy between two terms. See discussion of this issue above. (In
the short term, the editor may be permitted to enter such an error, but it will
be reversed in batch processing later. Eventually the editing software will
return an error message if the editor attempts to take such an action.) For this
reason and also due to differences in hierarchical perspective in different
source vocabularies, there will inevitably be some inconsistencies in the set of
non-synonymous relationships present in the Metathesaurus.
<BR>
<BR></P>
<P><B>Associated MeSH Expressions or ATXs</B>    
<BR>At this point editors are not assigning ATXs to concepts in the
Metathesaurus. This is another area where we will need to do further research
since ATXs have not been worked on for years. It is not necessary to understand
about ATXs at this point in time in order to do Metathesaurus editing.
<BR>
<BR>An associated MeSH expression was created when a combination of MeSH
concepts provided a more precise connection to MeSH and a better chance of
retrieving relevant information from a MeSH-indexed database than any single
MeSH concept would have  provided. Here are some typical cases. (The examples
that follow include the exact punctuation and syntax that appears in the ATX
(associated expression) data element in the Metathesaurus. A full explanation of
this syntax appears in the UMLS Documentation.)
<BR> 
</P>
<P>-- A MeSH main heading/subheading combination provides a much better match
than a main heading alone.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR> e.g.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lithotripters
= MeSH: &lt;Lithotripsy&gt;/&lt;instrumentation&gt;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Copper poisoning = MeSH: &lt;Copper&gt;/&lt;poisoning&gt; 
</P>
<P>-- In MeSH, the combination of a anatomic site and another concept or an age
group and another concept or some analogous combination may provide the best
match to a &quot;pre- coordinated&quot; concept in another vocabulary.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR> e.g.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thumb Injuries = MeSH: &lt;Thumb&gt;/&lt;injuries&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pregnancy in Middle Age = &lt;Pregnancy&gt; AND &lt;Middle Age&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Protective Eyeglasses = MeSH: &lt;Eyeglasses&gt; AND &lt;Protective Devices&gt;<BR>
<BR> -- MeSH has no equivalent concept, but has two or more narrower concepts
that together approximate the meaning of a more general concept in another
vocabulary.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR> Because the Metathesaurus is organized by concept, there are separate
Metathesaurus concepts for a MeSH main heading and its entry term(s) if the they
are not synonyms. If a MeSH entry term provides the closest relationship to a
non-MeSH term then the entry term should be used in the Associated expression.
For example, in MeSH different types of Lithotripsy, including &quot;Ultrasonic
Lithotripsy&quot;, appear as entry terms to the Main Heading &quot;Lithotripsy&quot;.
UMDNS has a concept &quot;Ultrasonic Lithotripters&quot;. The appropriate MeSH
expression for this term in the Metathesaurus is:&nbsp; &lt;Ultrasonic
Lithotripsy&gt; / &lt;instrumentation&gt;.&nbsp;   
<BR>When an Associated MeSH expression is created,  the editor must also
specify its relationship to the concept with which it is associated. The
expression can be synonymous (S), broader (B), narrower (N), or &quot;other&quot;
(O). The general guidelines for determining which of these relationships apply
are the same as those described under Relationships. In determining the proper
relationship, the editor should consider the type of information likely to be
retrieved from a MeSH-indexed database by the expression.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR> After constructing the expression, the editor must also identify which
components of the expression should also have individual relationships to the
concept at hand and make these relationships. The general guidelines for this
process are as follows:&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>1. Do not make individual relationships for the subheading(s) in the
expression.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>2. None of the component terms in the expression should have a synonymous
relationship to the concept at hand. If one of them is a synonym then the
expression has been created in error.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>3. &quot;Other&quot; is always the appropriate relationship for any MeSH
Main Heading or entry term in the expression that is qualified by a subheading.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>4. In expressions with AND, Main headings or entry terms separated by AND
may have the same or different relationships to the concept. Often the Main
heading or entry term on one side of the AND will have a &quot;Broader&quot; or &quot;Narrower&quot;
relationship to the concept and the Main heading at the other end will have an &quot;Other&quot;
relationship.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>5. Unqualified Main Headings or entry terms separated by OR will have the
same relationship to the concept.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>6. Beyond these rules, determination of the appropriate relationship for
components of an expression is guided by the same principles outlined in the
Relationship Guidelines.&nbsp;
