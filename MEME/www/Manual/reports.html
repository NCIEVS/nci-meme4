<H1>Concept Reports</H1>
<P><BR><B>&quot;As of . . . problems/issues&quot; -&nbsp; </B>These are &quot;canned
messages alerting editors to potential problems the engine detects in the
concept record; DO NOT assume these are the only problems.&nbsp; The complete
list of possibilities is presented later in this document.
<BR>
<BR><B>CN# </B>- (Concept Number) - An identifying numerical key for the
concept.&nbsp; It is useful to use this number in communications with humans and
computers.
<BR>
<BR><B>Concept Name</B> - A string chosen to represent the concept as a whole.&nbsp;
The name is selected from the atoms belonging to the concept by the computer.&nbsp;
The decision is based on a simple priority list (the term whose source/termtype
is highest on the list wins.)&nbsp; This list can be found in Appendix
<A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/METAB.HTML#b5">B.5 ORDER OF
PRECEDENCE OF SOURCE CONCEPT NAMES</A>.
<BR>
<BR><B>CUI </B>- (Concept Unique Identifier) - This is useful in file
maintenance, etc.&nbsp; It is not usually of concern to Metathesaurus editors.&nbsp;
The CUI appears as the letter C followed by 7 digits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unique
identifier for the Metathesaurus concept to which a term and string are linked.
The
<BR>number remains the same across versions of the Metathesaurus irrespective
of the term
<BR>designated as the preferred name of the concept. This facilitates file
maintenance and
<BR>management. In the Metathesaurus distribution formats all data elements are
linked to the
<BR>concept(s) to which they belong.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B>approved/not-approved </B>- Not all concepts in the Mid (the entire
working database) get included in the version of the Metathesaurus that is
released to the public.&nbsp; After a report is finished all concepts are
usually stamped with the editors initials and approved unless otherwise
indicated.&nbsp; Approval status can also be changed for individual concepts in
the interface.
<BR><B></B>
<BR><B>IMN </B>- (Internal MeSH Note)- One of the free text fields from M204
MeSH.&nbsp; These may have generally useful information (e.g., about ET-ET
synonymy or drug specifics) or information only of interest for the maintenance
of MeSH itself.&nbsp; Similar to the Meta Notes.
<BR><B></B>
<BR><B>LO/RO/AQ </B>- Editors can ignore these, they come from MeSH204.&nbsp;
LO = Locator Information (what files the concept has appeared in); RO = Record
Originator (Who worked on the record in M204 MeSH); AQ - Allowable Qualifiers
(What qualifiers can an Indexer use with this record).
