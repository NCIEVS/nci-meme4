<PRE>Editing Guidelines for CCPSS


Official Source Name:

        Canonical Clinical Problem Statement System


Termgroups:

Problems:  PT 
Term class:  TC 
Modifier: MP 
synthesized &quot;problems&quot; for TCs:  TX  


1. CCPSS source level relationships were inserted as Reviewed RT? rels. DO NOT
EDIT THESE RELATIONSHIPS. They will stay source level relationships and will
be released as CCPSS source rels.

2. We are taking the CCPSS terms on face value. If CCPSS has the term Haiti, we
are taking it to mean the country. If CCPSS has the term Kidney, we are taking
that to mean the body part. So, merging between CCPSS and other sources can and
will occur.

3. There are some concepts in CCPSS that are not apparent as to meaning. For
example:

ID
FM
Data

If an editor finds a CCPSS atom like this and can not determine meaning, copy
the concept into an e-mail message and send it to Tammy and Laura. Do not
edit it. If it has already merged into a concept with other atoms and you are
not sure of the meaning, send us e-mail with the concept (same as above).

4. We created a termgroup called TX. These terms were problems that we
fully specified, like Liver became Liver Problem:

CN# 847675  Liver problem
CUI C0577060	Concept Status needs Review
STY Finding   R
ATOMS
             R []  Liver problem [RCD99/PT/Xa7UW] 
             R         {Liver problem [RCD98/PT/Xa7UW]} 
  M          N       LIVER PROBLEM [CCPSS99/TX/U000046] 
  M          N         LIVER PROBLEM [CCPSS99/PT/0052733] 
DMS          N []  LIVER [CCPSS99/TC/U000046] 
 DM          N         LIVER [CCPSS99/PT/0050526] 
 

The TCs and TXs should always remain together. They will have the same code. In
the example above, the TC and TX both have the code of U000046.

If a concept has a CCPSS PT, this term should be taken on face value. Some
PTs may be in the wrong concept. In the example above, there are two PTs. One is
Liver Problem and should stay in the concept. The other is Liver and should be 
split out. The Liver PT term refers to the body part and should be merged with
the concept that already exists in the Metathesaurus for Liver the body part.
Note, the TC term of Liver does not get split out since it stays with its
corresponding TX.</PRE>
