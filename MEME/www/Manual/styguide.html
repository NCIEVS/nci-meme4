<h1>
Guidelines for Semantic Type Assignment</h1>
<b>Semantic Types (STY)</b>:&nbsp; Semantic Types are broad categories
to which a concept belongs (e.g., Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is
a "Disease or Syndrome".)&nbsp; The Semantic type(s) are the link between
the Metathesaurus and the UMLS Semantic Network.&nbsp; Application programs
may be able to use the Semantic type information to determine the general
topics of interest in a particular user query. Semantic types can also
be employed to access related information from the Semantic Network&nbsp;
for use in interacting with a user to refine a query and to select appropriate
information sources to search.
<p>1.&nbsp; Assign a concept to a particular semantic type only if the
concept is an "is_a" relationship to that type.&nbsp; Thus, it must be
possible to say that the concept under consideration is an instance of
the semantic type to which it is assigned.
<p>2.&nbsp; It is important to read the definition and usage note for each
semantic type.&nbsp; It is not possible to rely solely on the name of the
semantic type, since there are often shades of meaning involved.&nbsp;
The definition makes clear the intended meaning in the UMLS context.
<p>3.&nbsp; Parsimony should be a guiding principle in assigining types.&nbsp;
With the exception of the chemicals, which are generally typed by both
structure and function, most concepts should be typed by a single semantic
type.&nbsp; In fact, assigning more than one semantic type should represent,
in some way, a graduation of meaning approaching that of multiple meanings.
<p>a.&nbsp; Chemicals should only be assigned two types (structure and
function) when it is reasonable.&nbsp; For example, you sould not assign
the type "Functional Concept" to the concept ORGANIC CHEMICAL just so it
will have more than one type.
<p>4.&nbsp; Assign types according to the primary meaning of the concept.&nbsp;
In assigning types, it is important to capture the essence of a concept,
not necessarily all components of its meaning.&nbsp; Thus "acute myocardial
infarction" is given the type 'Disease or Syndrome'.&nbsp; It is not assigned
the semantic type 'Temporal Concept' even though there is a temporal aspect
to its name.
<p>5.&nbsp; Each semantic type in the UMLS Semantic Network exists in an
"is_a" hierarchy.&nbsp; Do not assign both parent and child semantic types
from an "is_a" hierarchy.&nbsp; Within the hierarchy, it may be assumed,
with few exceptions, that the child will participate in all the meaningful
realtionships that the parent participates in.
<p>a.&nbsp; The child may be thought of as a member of the same semantic
category as the parent, but with one or more additional semantic features.
<p>b.&nbsp; If all children of the same parent in the Semantic Network
apply, then the parent semantic type should be assigned.
<p>c.&nbsp; If some, but not all, children of the same parent apply, then
the individual children should be used.
<p>6.&nbsp; All concepts MUST have at least one type.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Respect the meaning of the concept in the source, not the categorization
by that source.&nbsp; The directive to "respect the source" is aimed at
not changing the meaning of the term in the source, not using categories
within the source which may have the same name as semantic types.&nbsp;
The semantic types assigned should not change the meaning of the concept.&nbsp;
Thus, if ICD is thought to classify "acquired abnormalities of the index
finger" as a disease (because ICD's name says it is a classification of
diseases), it should nonetheless be typed as 'Acquired Abnormality", and
not as 'Disease or Syndrome'.&nbsp; If it were typed as 'Disease or Syndrome',
this would not be consonant with the definition of the UMLS Semantic Types.
