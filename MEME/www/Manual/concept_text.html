<LI><B>7.1.4.0 Introduction to Concept screen - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Concept screen is the only screen where STYs (Semantic Types) can be edited. It also
provides editors with a quick overview of the information contained in a concept
(like atoms, context, etc.). However, it does not contain information about
relationships.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="concept"></P>
<P>As with previous screens, the concept identification information is
presented at the top of the screen in the yellow boxes. The CUI and concept_id
are in the first row and the concept name is given in the second row. An editor
should always be aware of which concept they are editing.</P>
<P>In the upper right corner, there is a button for &quot;Report&quot;. This
will take the editor to the concept report.  At the top of the screen, there is
also a menu option called Report. This lets an editor choose the display options
for the concept report but does not pull up the concept report. Only clicking
the green Report button will do this. Below that is a section for Semantic Types
and Concept Notes. Next to that is a listing of the atoms and corresponding
termgroups. Below the Semantic Types are definitions that are present in the
concept. Next to that is context information for the atoms present in the
concept. The bottom of the screen provides links to Lexical Tag information and
MeSH information. All these sections will be described below.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.1 Semantic Types (STYs) - </B></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="styeditor"></P>
<P>Semantic Types (STYs) are either assigned during Metathesaurus processing or
are assigned by editors.  Each concept must have at least one STY but can have
more than one.</P>
<P>The assigned Semantic Types are displayed with the name of the Semantic
Type, the Status, the editor who authorized the STY and the date it was
authorized. Near the bottom of the screen, the TUI of the STY is given (ex.
T047). The TUI is a unique number that is assigned to each STY.</P>
<P>The blue buttons near the bottom of the screen (only on the Sun editing
interface) or the menus at the top of the screen can be used to add, delete or
replace STYs.  To Add an STY (whether some exist already or if there are none)
on the Sun editing interface, the editor must first enter the STY. This can be
done two different ways. If the TUI is known, the editor can enter it into the
white box next to the blue TUI button (ex. T047). Then, the blue TUI button is
clicked. The full name of the STY will appear to the left and below the TUI and
will appear in the STY rows above. Once the STY appears in the Semantic Types
rows, it has been added to the concept.  If the editor does not know the TUI,
the name of the Semantic Type can be entered into the white box next to the blue
STY button. The name has to be entered exactly but the whole name does not
always have to be entered. If an editor types in enough of the name to
differentiate it enough from all other STYs, the system will know which STY the
editor is entering. Once the name is typed, the blue STY button is clicked and
the STY is added to the concept (just like if the TUI was used). For example, an
editor could just type Disease, click the blue button, and the correct STY will
be added. If an editor wants to add a new STY, the white Clear button is clicked
and the STY fields at the bottom of the screen are emptied. </P>
<P>On the PC and the Sun,  an editor can use the Add menu option at the top of
the screen to add STYs. The name of the STY can be typed into the STY box at the
bottom of the screen. Then, instead of clicking the blue STY button, the editor
can click on the bottom blue box. This makes the STY name appear in the blue box
as well as the TUI in its appropriate place. Then, the editor can just choose
the Add option from the menu. For this to work, the editor must make sure that
the full STY name appears in the blue box as well as the TUI in its place.
Otherwise, the system will not know which STY to add. The same can be done if a
TUI is used.</P>
<P>In order to delete a STY, the Delete menu option is used. The STY to be
deleted is highlighted in the STY list and the Delete option is chosen. The STY
will then be removed.</P>
<P>If there are multiple STYs (or even just one STY) and an editor wants to
replace them all with one STY, the Replace All menu option can be used. If the
Replace All option is chosen, it replaces all the STYs that currently exist with
the one the editor has entered.  </P>
<P>There is also a Status menu option that can be used to change the status of
a STY.  The STY is highlighted and the editor can choose to make the STY
Reviewed (R) or Needs Review (N).</P>
<P>If an editor would like to see a list of all the STYs, the Show All button
on the right side can be clicked. It will open a screen listing all the STYs,
the hierarchy and provide a link to the STY definition. The green DEF button
below it will show the editor the definition of the STY that appears at the
bottom of the STY screen.</P>
<P>An editor can also use the buttons on the right side of the screen to
approve  or Not Approve the concepts. If all an editor needs to change is the
STY, the concept can be approved from the STY screen once the changes are made.
Approve/Next will  approve the concept and move on to the next one on a
worklist. The Not Approved/Next button will not approve the concept and move to
the next one on a worklist.</P>

<LI><B>7.1.4.2 Concept Notes - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="conceptnotes"></P>
<P>Concept Notes are created by editors and stay with the concept unless
deleted. They are not released to the Metathesaurus users and are for internal
editing use only. When writing concept notes, it is a good idea to place the
editor's initials and the date next to the note (as in the example above) so
that other editors will know who wrote it and when.</P>
<P>When a Concept Note is added, the Concept Note button on the Concept screen
will turn red. This alerts editors to the fact that one or more Concept Notes is
present and should be looked at.</P>
<P>To Add a concept note, type the note in the big white box at the bottom of
the screen. Then, click on the Add menu option. Once a concept note is added,
the concept name will appear as well as the editors initials and the date added
(See example above).  Once a concept note is added, it can not be edited. To
change a concept note, a new one needs to be created and the old one deleted. To
delete a concept note, simply highlight the row for the concept note to be
deleted and then choose the delete menu option. An editor can also use the
Status menu option to change the Status of the concept note.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.3 Concept Source and Termgroup - </B></LI></UL>
<P>This section gives editors information about the atoms that appear in the
concept. Nothing in this list can be edited from this screen. It provides
editors a list that contains the Termgroup (which indicates which source the
atom came from), the source code and the atom name for the atoms that are
present in the concept.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.4 Definitions - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Definition(s) section contains any definitions that are in the concept.
These usually come from the sources themselves. A little white box at the top of
this section lists how many definitions there are. Then, they are listed
alphabetically by source with the source abbreviation at the beginning. In front
of the source abbreviation are two fields that tell an editor whether the
definition is released (Yes or No) and the Status of the definition (R or N).
</P>
<P>The blue DEF button will take the editor to the Definitions Editor screen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="definitions"></P>
<P>The Definitions Editor screen can be used to Add or Delete definitions.
Definitions that come from a source can not be deleted. This screen also allows
editors to set the Status and Releasability of a definition.</P>
<P>For each definition, the atom_id, the source termgroup, the atom name, the
releasability, the Status, the editor that last approved the definition and the
date of approval are all listed The definition is also displayed near the bottom
of the screen. To add a definition, the definition is typed into the definition
box. Then, the Add menu option is chosen. To Delete a definition, the atom is
highlighted from the list and the definition menu option is chosen.</P>
<P>There are two ways to change the releasability. The atom to be changed is
highlighted. Then, the editor can choose the desired Release option from the
menu. Or, the editor can click on one of the two green buttons that are above
the atom list - &quot;not tobe released&quot; or &quot;tobe released&quot;.</P>
<P>The status of the definitions can also be changed by using the Status menu
option.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.5 Context Hierarchy - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Context Hierarchy section displays the hierarchies for the atoms in the
concept. The hierarchies come from the sources but not all atoms will have a
hierarchy to be displayed. The white boxes at the top of the contexts tells an
editor how many contexts there are and which context out of the total  is being
looked at. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.6 Lexical Tags - </B></LI></UL>
<P>On the bottom left side of the Concept screen, there is a button for Lex
Tag. This leads an editor to the Lexical Type Editor. Next to the button is
another field.  If a Lexical Tag is already present, it will appear in this
field.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A><IMG SRC="lextags"></A></P>
<P>The Lexical Type Editor allows an editor to add or delete Lexical Tags to
atoms in a  concept. There are two Lexical Tags that can be added - Trade name
and Lab Number. </P>
<P>The Lexical Type Editor needs to be used in conjunction with the Classes
screen and will be discussed in more detail in Section 7.1.5.6.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.4.7 Mesh Attributes and Internal MeSH Notes - </B></LI></UL>
<P>At the bottom of the right side of the Concept screen, there are two buttons
for MeSH Attr. and  IMN (Internal MeSH Note). These are informational fields
that contain information about MeSH atoms that are in the concept. They are
taken from the MeSH system and are not editable. Not all concepts have MeSH
atoms and not all MeSH atoms have data in these fields. If an IMN is present,
then the IMN button will be red to indicate that there is information in this
field.</P>
<P>The Not Approved/Next button is also used with concepts from a worklist. If
an editor does not want to approve a concept but wants to move on to the next
concept on a worklist, this button would be used.</P>
