<LI><B>7.1.3.0 Introduction to Concept Selector (SEL) screen - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="mainsel"></P>
<P>The Concept Selector (SEL) screen is a good starting place for editing to
begin. It compiles a list of the concept(s) to be edited and has links to other
editing screens. A concept can be edited on the SEL screen only when it is the
Current Concept (CC). The Current Concept  concept_id and concept name are
displayed in the long yellow box at the top of the screen as well as the concept
status, the preferred termgroup (which determines the concept name), and the
preferred atom code. A concept can not be edited if it is not the CC. If a
concept is selected from the Finder to be edited, it will automatically be the
Current Concept. Other ways of making a concept be the Current Concept are
discussed later on.</P>
<P>Near the top left hand side of the screen is the Editor box. It lists the
initials of the editor currently using the interface. These are the initials
that will appear on the concept when changes are made to show which editor made
the changes.</P>
<P>The Edit List contains all the concepts being stored in the SEL screen. Only
one can be the current concept but an editor  can keep a list of concepts ready
to edit in the Edit List. The Edit List displays the termgroup of the preferred
atom (which determines the concept name), the code of the preferred atom, the
concept_id, the concept name, and the action being performed with the concept
(under Action Selector). Concepts can be removed from the Edit List  by clicking
on the white button &quot;Remove Concept from Edit List&quot;.  The Current
Concept can not be removed from the list.</P>
<P>At the top left of the screen, there are two green buttons. The Report
button pulls up the concept report for the Current Concept.  The Finder button displays the Finder screen (see section 7.1.2)
so that the editor can search for new concepts at any point it is needed. To the
right, there are two orange buttons (Attribute and Sources) which will be
discussed in the following sections.</P>
<P>Also discussed in the following sections are the ADD buttons at the bottom
left side of the screen and the approval buttons on the bottom right side of the
screen.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.1 Menu and Speed Keys - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Menu options at the top of the screen allow editors to perform the same
editing actions as the buttons present throughout the screen. The speed keys
allow editors to perform actions using the Control Key and another specified key
on the keyboard (ex. Ctrl-C).</P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="speedkeys"></P>
<P>An action from the menu options is chosen by holding down the left mouse
button and highlighting the desired action. Then, the mouse button is released
and the action is performed. The Close menu allows the editor to close the SEL
screen and any other screens that were opened from the SEL screen. The Report
menu displays all the different options for displaying concept reports. The
Status menu allows an editor to change the status of the Current Concept.  The Next menu moves an editor through a worklist by
Approving or Not Approving concepts as the editor goes from concept to concept
in the worklist. The ADD menu has the same search options as the ADD buttons at
the bottom of the SEL screen. An editor can search for other concepts using the
concept_id, code, file list or CUI. The Save menu is used if an editor wants to
save the contents of an Edit List for future editing. The editor highlights this
menu choice, provides a name for the file and then saves the file. The Speed
Keys menu does not perform any actions. It just lists the keys that can be used
to perform the same actions as the menus and the buttons on the SEL screen.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.2 ADD buttons - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="lookup"></P>
<P>At the bottom of the screen, there are 4 white rows  (with blue ADD buttons
at the end of each) that aid editors in retrieving concepts (using codes and
numbers instead of words). The first row is Concept_id. If an editor knows the
id of a concept they would like to edit, the concept_id can be entered in the
white box and the ADD button is clicked. The matching concept will appear in the
Edit List. If another concept is in the list and is already the CC, the new
concept will not automatically become the new CC. If the concept_id can not be
found, a message box will appear saying &quot;Concept Not Found&quot;. The
editor needs to click the OK button in the box in order to continue. A blank
line will also appear in the edit list to indicate that no concept was found
with that id.</P>
<P>The next row is Read Edit List from file. An editor can save to a file a
list of concepts that they have in the Edit List for editing at a future date.
In this row, the editor lists the name of the file that was saved and clicks the
ADD button. The list of  concepts saved in the file will appear in the Edit
List.</P>
<P>The next row is for Code. The code refers to the code that a source gives it
terms to differentiate them in their vocabulary (ex. D000163 is a code MeSH uses
with its Main Headings). The Metathesaurus tries to maintain these codes with
their corresponding terms. So, if an editor knows the code of an atom in a
concept, the code can be used to search for concepts with atoms assigned to that
code. The code has to be entered into the box exactly as it appears in the
source.</P>
<P>The last row is for CUI. If an editor knows the CUI of a concept, the CUI
can be entered into the box and the ADD button clicked. The matching concept
will appear in the Edit List. Again, if another concept is already in the list
as the CC, the new concept will not become the new CC. If the CUI is not found,
an error message will appear (like the one an editor gets if the concept_id is
not found).</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.3 Action Selector - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Action Selector is a picklist that appears with each concept row on the
Edit List. It is a way to make a concept the Current Concept and to perform
other actions like merging and relationship creation.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="actionsel"></P>
<P>To use the Action Selector, an editor highlights the desired action from the
picklist. Then, the blue &quot;Do the action&quot; button is clicked and the
action is performed.  The actions that can be performed are as follows:</P>
<P><STRONG>Make CC -
</STRONG>This makes the concept in the corresponding row the Current Concept.</P>
<P><STRONG>Link as BT to CC - </STRONG> A relationship of Broader Than will be
made between the concept in the row and the Current Concept. When this action is
performed, the relationship screen also has to be open.</P>
<P><STRONG>Link as NT to CC - </STRONG>A relationship of Narrower Than will be
made between the concept in the row and the Current Concept. When this action is
performed, the relationship screen also needs to be open.</P>
<P><STRONG>Link as RT to CC - </STRONG> A relationship of Other Related will be
made between the concept in the row and the Current Concept. When this action is
performed, the relationship screen also has to be open.</P>
<P><STRONG>Link as XR to CC - </STRONG>A relationship of Not Related will be
made between the concept in the row and the Current Concept. When this action is
performed, the relationship screen also has to be open.</P>
<P><STRONG>Merge into CC - </STRONG>If an editor feels that a concept is
synonymous with the Current Concept, this action will merge the two concepts
into one concept. The Edit List will display the newly merged concept once the
action is complete.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.4 Report - </B></LI></UL>
<P>In the upper right hand corner, there is a green button with &quot;Report&quot;
on it. This button leads editors to the Concept Report for the Current Concept
in the Edit List.  There is also a menu option called Report. As seen in the
image below, the Report Menu Option displays the different display choices for
relationships on the concept report. Concepts can have  context relationships
and hidden relationships that are not displayed on the default concept reports.
The different display options allow editors more choices in the information they
can view.  For more information on these report options,
<A HREF="rels_concept.html">click here.</A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A><IMG SRC="report_options"></A></P>
<P>If an editor wants to change the relationship display on a concept report,
the editor opens the Report picklist. Then, highlights the option that is
needed. Once this is done, the green Report button is clicked and the concept
report screen will open. The new display option needs to be selected before the
green Report button is clicked. Also, every time a new display option is
selected, the green Report button needs to be clicked.</P>
<P><BR></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.5 Attribute - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Attribute button is located on the top right side of the SEL screen.
When clicked, it pulls up the Concept Attributes screen which shows editors all
the attributes that are associated with the Current Concept. This is the only
screen that displays this information.</P>
<P>The name and concept_id  of the concept are displayed in the yellow row at
the top of the screen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="attribute"></P>
<P>There are seven columns of information on this screen. There can be an
unlimited number of rows of information containing attributes for the concept.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Switch - The two values in this column are Y (yes) and N (no). The switch
has to be turned to Y in order for a row to be moved, deleted, etc. In order to
change the switch to Y, an editor highlights the row to be edited and clicks the
green &quot;Switch&quot; button. More than one row can be switched to Y at the
same time.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Level - This provides information on  where the attribute came from. There
can be two values -S and C. A S means that this attribute came from the source
itself and is a source level attribute. A C means that the attribute was made at
the concept level (by Metathesaurus processing or an editor) and it is a
concept-level attribute. This includes attributes like CUIs and Semantic Types.</LI>
<LI>Atom_id - This is the atom_id number that the attribute refers to. A
concept can have multiple atoms and each atom can have one or more attributes.
If there is a zero in the atom_id field, that means that the attribute is
attached to the whole concept (like the CUI) and not just to an individual atom.</LI>
<LI>Attribute Name - This describes what the attribute represents.</LI>
<LI>Attribute Value - This is the actual attribute value.</LI>
<LI>Source of Attribute - This lists an abbreviation of the source of the
attribute. It can be an editor (i.e. E-TMC), a source, or the Metathesaurus.
</LI>
<LI>Status - This represents the Status of each attribute. A R means that the
attribute is Reviewed, a N means that the attribute Needs Review and an U means
that the attribute is Unreviewed.</LI></UL>
<P>At the top of the screen is an option to Move or Delete attributes. To move
an attribute to another concept, the new concept_id is entered into the white
box at the top of the screen labeled &quot;Move to Concept_ID:&quot;. Then, the
editor selects the move command at the top of the screen. If an editor wishes to
delete an attribute, the attribute is highlighted and the delete option is
selected. Only concept level attributes can be moved or deleted. Of concept
level attributes, CUIs can not be deleted. If an editor tries to delete a CUI or
a source level attribute, an error message will appear and the action will be
blocked.</P>
<P>The Status of an attribute can also be changed. At the top of the screen,
there is a drop down menu for the different status options. In order to change
the status, the row of the attribute to edit needs to be highlighted. The row is
switched on, the desired Status is highlighted from the drop down menu and the 
change occurs. The new status will appear automatically on the screen.</P>
<P>The last feature on the interface is the sort option. If there are numerous
attributes (number of attributes is displayed in a white box on the right hand
side), the editor can use the Sort picklist to sort the attributes by any of the
columns (except Switch). This provides a way for editors to reorganize the data
on the screen for easier editing.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.6 Sources - </B></LI></UL>
<P>Sources allows an editor to see where each atom in the concept comes from.
There are two screens that appear when the Sources button is clicked: Atoms and
Sources.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="sources"></P>
<P>The Sources screen lists all the sources that have an atom in the concept.
The Atoms screen lists the atoms that come from each source. To view the atoms
from a source, simply highlight the source from the Sources list and then click
on the highlighted source. The corresponding atoms will appear in the Atoms
screen. The Atoms screen lists the termgroup, code and atom name for each atom.
These screens provide information for the editors but no editing can occur from
these screens.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.7 Approval buttons - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="approval"></P>
<P>Once a concept has been edited, the goal is for it to become an approved
concept. Approval of a concept gives it a Status of Reviewed (R) and it does not
have to be edited again unless a change is made.  If an editor does not feel
confident that a concept is correct, they can not approve a concept and move on.
Not approving a concept leaves the status as Needs Review (N). </P>
<P>The Approve/Next button is used when approving concepts from a worklist. The
worklist has been selected by the editor to work on (see Section 7.1.1.3). As an
editor moves thorough the worklist and concepts are ready for approval, the
Approval/Next button will approve the concept and bring the next concept on the
worklist to the SEL screen for editing.</P>
<P>The Approve button can be used for any concept whether it is on a worklist
or not. It simply approves the concept and leaves it on the SEL screen. The
editor has to manually change another concept to the Current Concept in order
for editing to continue. </P>
<P>The Not Approved/Next button is also used with concepts from a worklist. If
an editor does not want to approve a concept but wants to move on to the next
concept on a worklist, this button would be used.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.3.8 Access to other editing screens - </B></LI></UL>
<P>The SEL screen can also be used to open other editing screens. When these
screens are open, they provide more information on the Current Concept.  There
are blue buttons near the Approval buttons that can be clicked to open the other
screens.</P>
<P>Concept opens the Concept screen. This screen provides details on the
semantic types, context, concept notes and other information (See Section
7.1.4). Class opens the Class screen which shows all the atoms in the Current
Concept (See Section 7.1.5). Relationship opens the Relationship screen which
shows all the relationships associated with the Current Concept to be viewed.</P>
