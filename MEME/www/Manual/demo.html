Demotions</H1>

<BR>Demotion reports generally involve PAIRS of concepts containing multiple
terms (a.k.a. &quot;atoms&quot;). Occasionally, N-way concept demotions
may occur, appearing as concept TRIPLES or worse on your reports.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Fundamentally, a demotion can be defined as a failed/banned/prohibited
merger of 2 ATOMS in DIFFERENT concepts which would have unified both CONCEPTS
into a SINGLE one; instead, the matching fact (saying that atom A is identical
to or a strong lexical variant of atom A') is &quot;demoted&quot; by our
MID merging engine into an UNapproved [O] Relationship (UR) between these
2 concepts. In paper concept reports, that demoted RELATIONSHIP (UR) is
marked with a leading &quot;D&quot; or &quot;d&quot;; in addition, the
demoted &quot;matching&quot; ATOMS in each concept are flagged with a leading
&quot;D&quot; or &quot;d&quot;. These flags indicate the quality of the
failed matching fact (D=exact match; d=lexical variant match); exact &quot;D&quot;
match demotion concepts MUST become &quot;multiple meaning&quot; concepts
upon Metathesaurus release, if the concepts remain unmerged.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>It's easy to identify which ATOMS matched! The hard part is to understand
why the CONCEPT merge was prohibited.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Let's take a simple case. One vocabulary source says atom A is synonymous
with (or a lexical variant of) atom B, while another source says atom A'
has a NON- synonymous AR relationship (RT/BT/NT) with atom B'. One &quot;source&quot;
is actually the current state of the MID, often the previously released
Metathesaurus. Atoms A and A' are identical or strong LV's, as are atoms
B and B' -- hence a conflict that the engine cannot resolve!!! By random
order of matching facts in the engine, A' and B' will either merge or demote,
yielding two concepts. One concept, A-B-A' or A-B-B', a triple, will have
a UR relationship to the concept with the remaining atom, either B' or
A', respectively. This UR link is the so-called DEMOTION, visible from
the concept on EITHER side of the UR relationship. In this case of conflicting
relationships, the two concepts will also have an AR relationship inherited
from the A'-to-B' source rel.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>First, a history lesson! From the school of hard knocks and experience
since Meta-1.0 (=Meta90), we all learned to engineer a CONSERVATIVE MID
merging engine. If there is any evidence that 2 concepts should NOT merge,
even if that evidence is dated or WRONG, then don't merge, DEMOTE! Even
today, it's still easier to merge 2 concepts in the editing interface than
to split a single concept into 2 or more concepts; the latter requires
dissecting atoms, redistributing MANY relationships, and reassigning semantic
types ... all of which must be done on-line, at great human resource cost.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>To detect evidence that 2 concepts should be demoted instead of merging,
the current MID merging engine has a collection of rules (a.k.a. Merge
Inhibitors) which are toggled on or off in complex patterns (like bits
in a byte) while sets of matching facts get processed in a stepwise manner.
Frequently, custom rules are written for processing specific new sources
and/or their termtypes.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Generic Merge Inhibitors consist of rules like --&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>* Don't merge 2 &quot;approved&quot; concepts (i.e., with previous released
Meta atoms)&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>* Don't merge 2 concepts containing MSH97 atoms * Don't merge 2 concepts
containing other same-source atoms&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>* Don't break strong MSH97 AR's (i.e., OK to merge across weak [o] AR's)
* Don't break strong other source AR's (i.e., OK to merge across [o] AR's)&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>* Don't merge a MSH97 D#1/Q#1/C#1 concept with a MSH97 D#2/Q#2/C#2 concept&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>* Don't merge a MSH96/MH D#1 concept with a MSH97/XX D#2 concept&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Special Merge Inhibitors may have exceptions for specific sources or identical
source code merges. During MID merge engine processing, various patterns
of these M.I.'s may be toggled on or off at various points in the process,
in order to achieve the desired semantic results MOST OF THE TIME.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Although archeology can be interesting, you may never be able to unravel
all the mysteries of why a demotion actually did occur, given very limited
evidence in your concept reports. (We gurus need to explore database audit
trails that tell us which merge inhibitors were active and when.) So, let's
provide some caveats and guidelines!&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>1) STOP LIVING IN THE PAST! Don't obsess about why, since the engine is
conservative and might have been WRONG about failing to merge the concepts.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>2) Whether a pair or a gaggle of demoted concepts, EXAMINE EACH ONE IN
THE GROUP INDIVIDUALLY FOR CONTENT ERRORS. These concepts were excluded
from other editing sets because they needed to be paired up properly. They
must be reviewed for all the usual problems (STY, multiple meanings, merge
errors, PIR's, etc.) for the sources they contain. You may need to familiarize
yourself with important issues relevant to reviewing these &quot;alien&quot;
sources.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>3) DETERMINE IF THESE CONCEPTS SHOULD BE MERGED AS IS! Would doing so violate
MeSH semantics or the semantics of other sources; for example, we usually
prohibit merging atoms from the current year MeSH if those atoms have different
MeSH codes (D#,Q#,C#) -- this is often the case with other sources as well,
but MeSH is inviolate and generally triumphs in disputes. Most sources
are incompletely specified, having &quot;entry term&quot; relationships
that may be synonymous or not; the engine may have erred on the side of
caution, given incomplete knowledge. If your HUMAN review detects NO compelling
reasons to prohibit marriage, then merge the concepts ... the demotion
was too cautious or frankly wrong!&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>4) DETERMINE IF BRAIN SURGERY IS NECESSARY! Sometimes, as in routine editing,
concepts will need to be split due to incorrect automatic merging. This
may reflect multiple meanings, other subtleties, or simply MID merging
engine snafus. For demotion concepts, you may need to split out certain
atoms and merge them into the other paired concept, keeping the 2 concepts
separate. Or splitting out and remerging may need to be bidirectional to
repair BOTH concepts. In other cases, you may need to create yet another
concept with selected atoms that connote an entirely different meaning;
then, you may be able to merge the original pair of demoted concepts. The
nasty part of all this is cleaning up the AR and UR rels, moving them between
the proper pairs of concepts.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>5) DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR CHANGES! Whenever you do any splitting and/or remerging,
print out the concept report(s) when you are done. Double-check the atoms,
relationships, and other editable content to verify that the post-change
state of affairs is correctly what you intended. Unforeseen messes may
crop up after splits. Don't forget about atoms that may be hidden in the
LV or string classes. If you have a problem finding something on-line but
it still appears on the concept report, then it's still there. Ask for
help if you are unsure.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>6) DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY!!! Demotion concept review is the most interesting
and challenging editing you'll encounter in this project. It's like cramming
for final exams, helping you recall the details and put it all together.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Good luck! :-)&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>The demotion reports have been assembled as best as possible to pair up
demoted concepts so they print adjacent to one another.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
facilitates comparing the concepts to see whether they can be merged, and
deciding on paper which atoms and rels to move (or merge) as needed.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>NOTE: The reports may contain 3-or-more-way demotions, apparent from the
number of concepts with &quot;D&quot; or &quot;d&quot; flags in the UR
slot. They should be printed together in DESCENDING ID# order.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>WARNING: Due to sort order, a given concept may appear in multiple places
in a single report, or in different editor's reports. Since different demotions
may involve concepts A, B, and C, e.g. A-B and B-C, concept B may appear
twice in the same set or in different editor's sets. The last editor to
change and stamp a concept wins! This means possible collisions, disagreements,
and/or undoing of previous work! It is VERY important to study what is
on-line (i.e., CURRENT!) carefully when editing demotions -- your paper
report may be out of date!!!&nbsp;
