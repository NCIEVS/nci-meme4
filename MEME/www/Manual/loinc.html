<pre>Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC)
==============================================================================
The LOINC database provides a set of formal names and standardized codes for
identifying laboratory and clinical observations. The purpose is to facilitate
the exchange and pooling of clinical or laboratory results, such as blood
hemoglobin or serum potassium, for clinical care, outcomes management, claims
attachment, and research.&nbsp;

A fully-specified LOINC name consists of 5 or 6 colon(:)-delimited elements:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :::::

The component/analyte element of the fully-specified name may have up to 3
subelements separated by carets (^).&nbsp; The system (sample type/site) element of
the fully-specified name can have up to 2 subelements separated by carets (^).
Refer the LOINC User's Manual for detailed explanations of names and elements
at http://www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm

LOINC contains laboratory, clinical, and claims attachment "observation" names.
The Meta LCN attribute denotes whether a LOINC code pertains to laboratory (1),
clinical (2), or claims attachment (3).

Term types are related as follows:

SX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RX

Only LN, LO, and LX terms have a LOINC code.&nbsp; Remaining termgroups are derived
from an related to many LOINC code terms, hence have code=NOCODE.

DEFINITION RN for&nbsp;
CN:Component@Property@Time_Aspect@System@Scale_Typ@Method_Typ@Class If a LOINC&nbsp;
record includes a Related Name (RN, in field #8), these related names&nbsp;
become DEFINITION attributes with the notation "RN for CN:"
with the Fully Specified LOINC name as the attribute value.&nbsp;

This DEFINITION is intended to help the editors decide what the Related Name&nbsp;
means. Related Names are used in LOINC primarily to permit matching of
laboratory tests in the RELMA software and may be ambiguous and&nbsp;
or acronyms. The Fully Specified Name should make the RN
clear.</pre>
<b>Specific Editing Tips for Editors:</b>
<p>1. A concept that appears to be a ratio of two chemicals such as, 2-Aminoadipate/Creatine,
should be typed as "Quantitative Concept. Aother example of a ratio would be "ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE.OTHER FRACTIONS/ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE.TOTAL".
<p>2. If it appears to be an organism, take it on face value and apply
the appropriate Organism STY such as "Plant".

> {239806} S</pre>
3. Rast Classes such as FOXTAIL MEADOW ANTIBODY.IMMUNOGLOBULIN E.RAST CLASS
should be typed as "Qualitative Concept".
<p>Something like FOXTAIL MEADOW ANTIBODY.IMMUNOGLOBULIN E is considered
an immunoglobulin and should be typed as "Immunologic Factor" &amp; "Amino
Acid, Peptide, or Protein".
<p>4. A chemical with a modifier attached (other than FREE) such as, NEUTROPHIL
CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY.ATYPICAL or ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE.TOTAL, should be typed as "Laboratory or Test Result".
<p>5. A chemical with the word "Free" Attached such as, ANDROSTANOLONE.FREE,
should be typed as "Clinical Attribute".
<p>6. All the long strings from LOINC are "Clinical Attributes".
<p>7.&nbsp; More Hints on Assigining STYs
<p>Organism Attribute: Something that is going to be measured and applies
to the organism as a whole or one of it's major parts. Things like height/body
weight/body temperature.
<p>Clinical Attribute: Something that is going to be measured and it doesn't
apply to the entire organism then it is a clinical attribute. For example,
ACCOMIDATION&nbsp;WIDTH. MEASURED. If you aren't sure if something is a
"major part"&nbsp; or for some other reason can't decide between organism
attribute and clinical attribute, lean towards using clinical attribute.
<p>Pathologic Function: If the concept includes a finding as a result of
a pathologic function, for example Increased Intraocular Pressure, then
assign Path Function. Also: Ineffective airway clearance due to inflammation.
<p>Disease or Syndrome: If the concept includes a finding as a result of
a disease, then it should be typed as disease or syndrome.&nbsp; Ineffective
airway clearance due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
<p>If you are having trouble deciding between one of the above or a STY
has already been assigned that seems reasonable, you should not spend too
much time worrying about it or trying to change it.

<p>Rf265 is a code that corresponds to the Caraway Antibody. IGE. It should
be typed as Indicator, Reagent, or Diagnostic Aid, &amp; Amino Acid, Peptide
or Protein &amp; Immunologic Factor. You may also see other similar concepts
such as
<br>C70 that appear in the same field in the definition. These are also
test codes that correspond to antibodies.
<p>
<p>9. Anything that is written or created by medical staff like DIALYSIS RECORDS, DISCHARGE
NOTES, patient records, etc. should get the STY of "Intellectual Product".
