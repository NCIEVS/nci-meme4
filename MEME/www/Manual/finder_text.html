<LI><B>7.1.2.0 Introduction to Finder - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="finder"></P>
<P>The Finder screen is used to search for concepts based on words in the
concept names and atom names. It can be opened from the main screen
under the Edit option (see section 7.1.1).  An editor can search by one word, a
phrase, or use Boolean logic to link two words together that would appear in the
concept or atom name.  In order to work, the word being used to search has to be
at least 3 letters or more. Searching on a string of less than 3 characters will
result in zero concept retrieved.</P>
<P>The results of the search are displayed in the upper part of the Finder. The
concept_id, concept status and concept name are displayed alphabetically in a
list. The number of results obtained by the search is show in the upper right
corner (in example above, the search yielded 427 concepts). </P>
<P> There are 5 different methods that can be used for searching. To choose a
search method, simply click the diamond in front of the method name so that it
changes to yellow (see LC word in picture above). The search methods are LC
word, Norm Word, Norm String, Exact String and ID. They are described in the
sections below.</P>

<LI><B>7.1.2.1 LC word  - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="locate"></P>
<P>Search terms are entered in the boxes at the bottom of the Finder
screen (case does not matter). There are two fields to enter text. To search
using only one word, type the word in the first box (ex. diabetes). Then, click
on the Locate button located to the left of the box. This will search both the
concept names and atom names in the Metathesaurus and return the concept_id,
status, and concept name of the matching concepts in a list at the top of the
Finder. The list of matching concepts is arranged alphabetically by concept
name.  </P>
<P>Boolean logic can also be used while searching with this method. Like the
example above, search words can be entered into each box (only one word in
each box).  If the editor wants to find concepts that contain both words, the
AND button would be clicked instead of the Locate button. This performs a search
of &quot;diabetes and mellitus&quot; in the example above. If the editor wants
at least one of the words but not necessarily both words to appear in the
results, the OR button would be clicked and the search would be &quot;diabetes
or mellitus&quot; in the example above. The Boolean logic search feature can
only be used with the LC word method. Only one word can be entered in each box
with this method.</P>

<LI><B>7.1.2.2 Nrm word (Norm word) - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="normstring"></P>
<P>Norm word uses the norm index to take a search word, normalize it and then
perform the search.  The normalization process involves converting a word  into
its canonical form. Canonical forms are generated by uninflecting a word,
stripping a small number of stop words and plurals, and looking the uninflected
word up in an equivalence table. The norm results are shown in the bottom box in
the format of &quot;search word|norm&quot;. This allows the editor to see what
is being searched. For example, searching on diseases would search for diseases
and its singular form disease. In the example above, a norm search using feet
searches for feet and its singular form of foot. If a concept name or atom name has
either of these words in the name, it will be retrieved by the search.</P>

<LI><B>7.1.2.3 Nrm str (Norm string) - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="normword"></P>
<P>Norm string uses the same norm process as norm word. It is a good way to
search for a phrase or string of words. The normalization process involves
breaking a string into its constituent words, lowercasing each word and
converting it to its canonical form. Canonical forms are generated by
uninflecting each word, stripping a small number of stop words and plurals, and
looking the uninflected words up in an equivalence table.  For example,  the
phrase &quot;superficial injury of nose&quot; is searched as well as its
normalized form of &quot;injury nose superficial&quot;. This is the best method
to use to retrieve phrases or to search using more than one or two words. One
thing to remember is that two strings that have an identical norm may not be
equivalent or synonymous. For example, Home Nursing and Nursing Homes have the
norm form of &quot;home nurse&quot; but the two phrases do not have the same
meaning.

<LI><B>7.1.2.4 Exact String - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="exactword"></P>
<P>The exact string method is probably the method used the least in searching..
The search string has to be entered exactly as it appears in the concept or atom
name. Capitalization is important and the correct results will not be obtained
if the phrase is not entered exactly as it appears in the concept or atom name.
In the example above, Blood Coagulation retrieves the desired concept. If the
editor had entered blood Coagulation, the concept would not have been retrieved.</P>

<LI><B>7.1.2.6 Viewing results -</B> </LI></UL>
<P>After a search is completed, a list of concepts will appear. To view the
desired concept, the editor needs to highlight the result from the list. Then,
there are display options that appear near the bottom of the Finder. To just see
the Concept screen (which contains STY, atom and context information), simply
click on the Concept button after the concept is highlighted from the list. If
an editor wants to go right in and edit the concept, the Edit button can be
clicked and the Concept Selector (SEL) screen appears. If another concept is
highlighted and the Edit button is used, the previous concept will be removed
from the SEL screen. If an editor wishes to move more than one concept over to
the SEL screen to be edited, the Transfer to SEL button would be used. This
allows the editor to go back and forth between the SEL screen and the Finder
while adding new concepts to be edited without removing concepts that are
already in the SEL screen.</P>
<P>If a new search is desired, the Clear buttons can be used to clear the
search terms from the boxes. The red Close button can be used to close out
of Finder. At the top of the Finder screen, there are also pull down menus that
can be used to close the interface and perform search functions in place of the
buttons.</P>
