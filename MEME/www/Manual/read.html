<LI>The letters CA (or Ca) can refer to either cancer or carcinoma. Atoms with
the letters Ca should only be merged with cancer or carcinoma when there is
adequate source information defining the intended meaning of Ca. Some Read
thesaurus Optional Preferred (OP) terms have only the letters Ca and an
associated body part (e.g. Ca Gallbladder) and do not specify the intended
meaning of Ca. In this situation, pending clarification from Read, Ca should not
be merged with either carcinoma or cancer. (Carcinoma is a subtype of cancer
that arises from epithelial tissue and carcinoma is generally not viewed as a
synonym for cancer. Cancer is synonymous with the terms malignant neoplasms and
malignant tumors).</LI></UL><BR>

<P>It is believed that all 'bracket terms' have the apparent meaning of the
RCDSY terms (which strip the bracketed letters) - <B>EXCEPT</B> the [V] terms.</P>
<P>[V] terms AND all ICD9 V codes AND all ICD10 codes under 'Factors
influencing health status and contact with health services' MAY have <B>DIFFERENT</B>
meanings from the apparent meaning and should be Multiple Meanings in those
cases.</P>
<P>The classic example is: </P>
<PRE>'V01.0 Cholera'
which means 
  'V01  Contact with or exposure to communicable diseases'
       'V01.0 Cholera'
or 'Contact with or exposure to cholera'</PRE>
<P>This example is currently edited and has a good PN; see CN# 467108.</P>
<P>The RCDSYs must always travel with the [V] terms they are made from. They
have to be edited with the knowledge that they well mean the something other
than the apparent meaning of the string.</P>
<P>In many cases, the 'stripped' RCDSY versions are involved in demotions. This
is unfortunate but correct because each of these cases needs editing and the
demotions will force that.</P>
<PRE>Definitions from Sources:

Read [V] terms; ICD-9 V codes; 
ICD10 'Factors influencing health status and contact with health services'
------------------------------------------------------------
[V] and all ICD V codes are 'Health Status and contact with health 
services factors' in Read;  the ICD-9-CM manual says:

  'This classification is provided to deal with occasions when 
   circumstances other than a disease or injury classifiable 
   to categories 001-999 (the main part of ICD) are recorded as
   &quot;diagnoses or &quot;problems.&quot; 

and goes on to list cases where a person not currently sick 
needs: 

  a) prohylactic vaccination, to discuss a problem which is not a 
     disease or injury, etc.;
  b) when a person is receiving treatment (e.g. dialysis for 
     renal disease, chemotherapy for malignancy, cast change
  c) circumstance which  which influences health status
     but is not a disease or injury.

<LI>Read98 uses  the code PT to represent Preferred Term and SY to represent
Synonymous  terms. Read views the separate PT's as being truly distinct
entities. Read also views the PT/SY relationships of the same code as being
truly  synonymous. In general, editors should not split Read SY's from their 
PT's unless there is a strong biomedical justification. Read also has OP's 
which represent optional or obsolete terms. These may be merged with PT's  as
discussed previously. Terms that are viewed as synonyms to OP's are  assigned as
IS (synonymous term to OP of the same code).  Editors should use their own
discretion  when editing IS's in Read98, since the relationship between OP and
IS terms may not be as consistently synonymous as the relationship between  PT
and SY terms.</LI></UL>
