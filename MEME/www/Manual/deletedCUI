Mapping of Deleted CUIs
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You will be given Excel files that contain CUIs that have been deleted
from the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; You will need to relate the delted CUI to
at least one CUI that currently exists in the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; In addition
you will need to pick one of the following relationship below other than
unassigned.
<p>--unassigned--this is the default and implies the editor has not worked
on this concept.
<br>--Synonym--
<br>--has NRW REL&nbsp;to--
<br>--has BRD REL to--
<br>--Other--Concept 1 has some relationship to concept 2
<br>--No match--The editor picks this on the RARE occasion that they cannot
find ANY concept that could even be generally related to the deleted concept.
These will have to be re-edited.
<br>--Not Mappable--Where concept 1 is not a useful biomedical concept
and is not mappable to any current UMLS concept (e.g., &amp;nbsp; in PDQ).&nbsp;
We anticipate that you will find very few if any of these on your worksheets.
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a living concept in the Metathesaurus that has the
same meaning?
<br>We found many cases where a source killed something because it contained
a typo.
<p>For example:
<p>LOINC had GLASCOW&nbsp;COMA&nbsp;SCORE.EYE OPENING
<br>this died but they created GLASGOW&nbsp;COMA&nbsp;SCORE.EYE&nbsp;OPENING
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2.&nbsp; Prefer to map to same source (try to find the parent)
<p>***Should we change this to:
<br>"If no synonymous concept, try to map to the same source first, prefer
the parent."
<br>????
<p>C0498076
<br>ONLAY-COMPOSITE/RESIN-PER TOOTH (IN ADDITION TO INLAY-LABORATORY PROCESSED)
<p>has NRW REL to
<p>C0498076&nbsp; Inlay/Onlay Restorations
<p>Both of these concepts were from HCPCs.&nbsp; C0498076 is a Hierarchical
term from the section that C0498076 came from.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3.&nbsp; Choose something inclusive rather than close in meaning.
<p>4.&nbsp; Check to make sure you are mapping to a CUI that is still alive.
<br>(Use the history button)
<p>5.&nbsp; If the meaning appears to be split (e.g. >1 STY) and all map
to are 1 STY) then map to multple CUIs.
<br>Or if the meaning cannot be mapped to any reasonble CUI than map to
multiple CUIs.
<p>6.&nbsp; Choose simple (&amp; general) as opposed to complex precoordinated
expression or multple CUIs.
<p>7.&nbsp; Start by clicking on the highlighted CUI to view the concept
report from the release files.&nbsp; If that doesn't yield a good match,
try using the approximate matching in the mid.
<p>8.&nbsp; Do NOT spend more than 10 minutes on any concept.&nbsp; After
10 minutes choose "no match".
<p>Other hints:
<p>Ctrl-W closes windows.&nbsp; It can get confusing if you leave too many
open so close them frequently.
