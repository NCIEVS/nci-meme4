Demotions:  We want to minimize the number of multi meanings from this.
We are going to lean towards letting NCBI win if there is a source conflict
with the exception of MeSH.

<p>So if SNMI has two different PTs for Bacterium A and Bacterium B and NCBI
says they are the same, merge them. NCBI is going to be our authority.
Don't spend time looking things up, assume NCBI is correct.

<p>Make sure we don't have cases where NCBI means bacterium and SNMI means
body parts merged together. Most of those should have demoted because
we prevented the merging.

<p>For MeSH, MeSH is usually correct in the area of virology and bacteriology.
So you can let MeSH win if there is a source conflict. 

<p>Be careful about common names. Sometimes the same name is used for several
species and a genus. In those cases you will need to allow for multi-meanings.

<p>Merge Set: For the most part, these merges are correct. The merges were
restricted to a small set including the organisms and some things like
Nucleotide sequence. You should not find any merges to things like food or
diseases. These should not take a long time to edit. For a 300 concept worklist, 
it shoud not take longer than about 3 hours. If you find it is taking you 
longer, you need to contact NLM. You will be able to tell these concepts by the 
name of the worklists (wrk02d_ncbi_merges. . . ). For the most part you
should assume the STYs are correct. Unless something looks wrong based on
your knowledge, don't worry about it.
