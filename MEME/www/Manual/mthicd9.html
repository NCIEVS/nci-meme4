<UL>
<LI>MTHICD9 contains ICD-ETs that were created by Apelon from the includes notes
in ICD9 and reviewed by editors. The ETs will have the same ICD9 code as the PTs
they correspond to.</LI></UL>
<PRE>The ICD-ETS are entry terms we created to correspond with an ICD2000/PT. The ETs 
can be synonymous to the PTs or have another rel like NT, BT, or REL. THe ETs 
are connected to the PTs by code.

If the code was the same and the strings matched, the ICD-ETs were merged in 
with the PTs. Otherwise, a rel was created.

The editing that needs to be done is this:

1. Check any merges to make sure they are correct.
2. Check the STYs. We defaulted the PT STYs to the ETs but they may not always 
be correct.
3. Check the ICD-ET rels that were created and change if needed. 

#3 is where it gets tricky. The rels were inserted as NSY C level rels. We did 
this because we wanted them to be obvious to editors which rels to review. Each 
C level rel as the original S level rel behind it. 

To review the rels, you need to see the S level rel in order to determine if it 
is correct or not. In order to facilitate this, the concept reports have been 
printed in such a way that the NSY C level rel is right next to the S level rel.

So, editors will look at any NSY rels. Then, look at the S level rel that exists 
with it. An editor is to decide if the S level rel is correct. If so, NOTHING 
HAS TO BE DONE. If the S level rel is correct, just leave the concept alone and 
when the concept is approved, the S level rel will win. If the S level rel is 
wrong, THE EDITOR HAS TO CHANGE THE NSY C LEVEL REL TO THE APPROPRIATE REL. This 
will then override the incorrect S level rel. THese NSY rels will appear as N in 
the editing interface.

There is one other editing task. We have clustered the concepts so that all 
concepts that contain ICD atoms with the same code are together. It is very 
possible that there is missed synoymy among the ICD-ETs. SO, an editor needs to 
pay attention to see if any of the ICD-ETs can be merged with each other. If 
they are synonymous, go ahead and merge them.
