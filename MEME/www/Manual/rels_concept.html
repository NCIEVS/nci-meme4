<BODY>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Relationship display options for Concept Reports </H1>
<P><BR></P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Display options from the Editing Interface</H3>
<P>In the past, the concept reports have shown only Winning relationships and
no context relationships. The context relationships come from the sources 
themselves and are distributed in the Metathesaurus release files. There are 
also &quot;hidden&quot; relationships that can exist with a concept. These are
generally  Source relationships that have been overridden by a new concept
relationship. Source relationships are released with the release files.</P>
<P>It was decided that it may be beneficial at times for editors to see this
information. Instead of having the information always appear on concept reports 
(which would have dramatically increased the length in many cases), NLM worked 
on a way to allow editors to choose what relationships and what context
relationships will be  displayed when necessary.
</P>
<P>The concept report display options can  be changed using the interface and
in Meow. There will be statements on the worklists that will tell the  editors
if more information exists. An editor can decide if they want to  see the
additional information and  then go into the interface to view. If an editor is
working  on a type of worklist and feels it would be beneficial to see
additional  information on all the concepts in the worklist, please contact NLM
and the worklist can be refreshed to display the additional information.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>What are the display options:</B></P>
<P>There are  9 display options. Below is a description of what each means and
what wording will display on the concept report screen to indicate the 
option(s) selected.</P>
<PRE>1. Show winning rels PAR CHD cxt rels if no context/rels (default)

Display on report screen:
Show WIN rels (default)		PAR &amp; CHD context (default)

This option shows the winning rels (which is what editors are use to). If a 
concept has no regular relationships OR it has no context displayed, the Parent 
and Child context relationships for that concept will be shown. There are three 
types of context relationships - Parent (PAR), Child (CHD) and Sibling (SIB). 

2. Show winning rels PAR CHD SIB cxt rels if no context/rels

Display on report screen:
Show WIN rels (default)		PAR &amp; CHD context w/SIB

This option shows the winning rels. The difference is that it will show PAR, 
CHD, and SIB context rels if no relationships are already present or if no 
context is present. The only difference between this option and #1 is that SIB 
context rels will be shown.

3. Show winning rels all context rels

Display on report screen:
Show WIN rels (default)		Show All Context Rels

This option shows the standard winning rels. It will also display all context 
rels present even if there are context and relationships present. This is a good 
way to see all the context rels if other relationships are present and if there 
is already a context displayed with the concept.

4. Show winning rels, plus XRs and corresp. rels  PAR CHD cxt if no context/rels

Display on report screen:
Show WIN, XR &amp; correspond	PAR &amp; CHD context (default)

This option shows the winning rels (default) plus any XR relationships that 
exist. Along with the XR relationship, its corresponding rel is displayed. An XR 
may have been created when a another rel was overridden. This will display both 
rels side by side. Example:

XR(S) AND CORRESPONDING RELATIONSHIP(S)
[NOT]  {Cold brand of chlorpheniramine-phenylpropanolamine [MTH/PN|E-TPW|RCD99] 
{1709051} C}
[REL]  {Cold brand of chlorpheniramine-phenylpropanolamine [MTH/PN|RCD99|RCD99] 
{1709051} P}

The context rels follow the default of showing PAR and CHD context rels if no 
rels or context are present.

5. Show winning rels, plus XRs and corresp. rels PAR CHD SIB cxt rels if no 
context/rels

Display on report screen:
Show WIN, XR &amp; correspond	PAR &amp; CHD context w/SIB

This option shows the XR rels as explained in #4. The context rels are the same 
as in #2 with the SIB rels displaying also.

6. Show winning rels, plus XRs and corresp. rels  all context rels

Display on report screen:
Show WIN, XR and correspond		Show All Context Rels

This option shows the XR rels as explained in #4. All of the context rels are 
displayed regardless of the fact that relationships or context may already be 
displayed (see #3).

7. Show all rels  PAR CHD cxt rels if no context/rels

Display on report screen:
Show all rels				PAR &amp; CHD context (default)

This shows all the relationships attached to the concept (both hidden and 
winning). The default behavior for the context rels is used (see #1 for 
details).

8. Show all rels  PAR CHD SIB cxt rels if no context/rels

Display on report screen:
Show All Rels				PAR &amp; CHD context w/SIB

This shows all the relationships attached to the concept (both hidden and 
winning). The context rels are displayed as explained in #5.

9. Show all rels  show all context rels

Display on report screen:
Show all rels				Show all context rels

This shows all the relationships attached to the concept (both hidden and 
winning). All context rels are also displayed regardless of the fact that 
context or relationships may exist.

There will be new section headings on the report in the relationships area. They 
are:

CONTEXT RELATIONSHIP(S) - where the context rels are displayed
XR(S) AND CORRESPONDING RELATIONSHIPS - where the XR rels display option will 
appear
ALL RELATIONSHIP(S) - this heading is used when all the rels are displayed (both 
winning and hidden)

<P><B>Examples of what an editor will see on a concept report:</B></P>
<P>As mentioned, concept reports will show if there are context relationships
present or hidden relationships present. This tells the editor that more
information is available and can be seen from the editing interface. Examples of
what will appear on the concept reports are:
</P>
<PRE>There are 11 context relationships not shown here.
There are 23 hidden relationships not shown here.</PRE>
<P><BR></P>
<P><B>How to use the report display options in the editing interface:</B></P>
<P>Concept reports can be called from the Concept Selector (SEL) screen or the
Concept screen. On both of these windows, there is now a new menu option at the
top called Report. It is a pull-down list that contains 9 options. If an editor
just clicks the green Report button (as usual), the default concept report will
be displayed (this is also #1 on the pull-down list). If an editor wants to 
change the display, they choose one of the 9 options from the list. Then, click
the green Report button. The concept report screen will pop up with the report
displayed with the options selected. An editor can tell which display option is
shown by looking at the bottom of the report screen. The type of rels displayed
and the type of context rels displayed will be shown and should match the option
the editor selected. If an editor keeps the report screen open but wants to 
change the display option, simply choose a new option and click the green Report
 button. The report screen will refresh with the new information.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<H3>Display options from Meow concept reports</H3>
<P>The concept reports themselves will have the same features as the ones that
are pulled up from the editing interface. The difference comes in how to tell
the database that a different relationship display option is needed.</P>
<P>An editor selects a concept report to view in the same manner as before and
the default display option will be used. Once the default concept report is
displayed, there will be some new picklists at the top of the screen.  The first
picklist will define the relationship view. The options are Winning Rels (which
is the default), Winning and XR rels, and Show All. The next picklist is for
choosing the display of the Context Relationships. The options are Par+Chd if no
Cxt Rels, Par+Chd+Sib if no Cxt Rels, and All Contexts. Any combination of the
relationship view options can be used together with any of the context
relationship options.</P>
<P>To change the display, simply highlight the desired choice from one or both
picklists. Then, click the Refresh button. The concept report will refresh with
the selected options.</P>
<P>There is also a button for seeing the CUI-centric report for the concept.
The CUI-centric report uses information from the Release Files to supplement the
information contained in the concept reports This view will be helpful when
deciding what CUIs should be assigned to which concepts when splits and merges
are done. To see this, simply click on the Get It button. If an editor wishes to
change the relationship displays using the picklists, the Refresh button must be
used. The Get It button will only show the CUI-centric report and not the
relationship display options.</P>
