they relate.
<p>Editing Birth Control Pills
<pre>The concept below is a medical device not a clinical drug.
21 day supplies are not eqv to the 28 day supplies of birth control
pills. If they don't specify, they don't mean the same thing as the 21
or 28 day supply. They should be related to the concept that contains
the ingredients (ETHINYL ESTRADIOL 0.02 MG / FERROUS FUMARATE 75 MG / 
NORETHINDRONE ACETATE 1 MG ORAL TABLET) which is a clinical drug.

Example:

The Ortho-Novum 1/35 Tab, 28 belongs in it's own concept with the
STY Medical Device. The Ethinyl Estradiol. . . .belongs in a concept
with all the other matching strings and clinical drug. All the other
matching strings are in concepts with TRD birth control pill packs so
those all have to be split out. Then there is also missed synonymy,
like another source has something that means Ortho-Novum 1/35 Tablets 28 days
(but they probably shouldn't spend time looking for that).


As of 15-nov-2001 00:26:37, this entry had the following problems/issues:
     Demotions are present in Concept.
     Concept contains an ambiguous string but no MTH/PN.
     Concept contains an ambiguous string but is lacking a relationship to other 
concepts sharing that string.

<p>Packaging Information
<pre>
In the hypothetical examples below, they would all end up with the same
SNF (something like montelukast sodium 4 mg Oral Tablets) and we would
merge them together. Because we don't care about how many pills
are in the bottle or other packaging information. We only care about
the ingredient, the dose, route, and form.


Montelukast sodium 4 mg Tablets bottles of 30

Montelukast sodium 4 mg Tablets bottles of 90

Montelukast sodium 4mg Tablets bottles of 100 w/ child proof seal

Montelukast sodium 4 mg Tablets 100 units, aluminum foil-backed peelable blister 
packs

Montelukast sodium 4 mg Tab single dose</pre>
<p>Another Example
<pre>
The case below the PRN & CD appear to be synonymous with RCD. The SCD looks
questionable but we are going to review those as a separate project. SO I
would ignore for now. The STY does need to be changed to clinical drug.
