<LI><B>7.1.6.0 Introduction to Relationships screen - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="relscreen"></P>
<P>The Relationships Screen is used to display all the relationships in a
concept and allows these relationships to be edited.  As usual, the concept name
and concept_id is present at the top of the screen in a yellow box so that the
editor is always aware of which concept is being edited.</P>
<P>Relationship information is contained in the center of the screen. There is
a row for each relationship contained in the concept and then eight columns of
information. The columns are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Switch - The two values in this column are Y (yes) and N (no). The switch
has to be turned to Y in order for a row to be edited. In order to change the
switch to Y, an editor highlights the row to be edited and clicks the green  &quot;Switch&quot;
button. More than one row can be switched to Y at the same time.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Termgroup -  Contains the abbreviation of the source and term type of the
atom.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Concept Name  - This is the concept name of the concept the rel has been
linked to.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Rel - This lists the type of rel between concepts. It uses abbreviations
for the relationship types.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Level - Level type of Rel - C (Concept level), S (Source level), P
(Processed level)</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Source of Rel - Initials of source or editor that created the relationship.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Status - Lists the status of the relationship- R (Reviewed), N (Needs
Review) or U (Unreviewed).</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Authority - Initials of last source or editor that approved the
relationship.</LI></UL>
<P>There is a sort list at the top of the relationship rows that allows editors
to change the order of how the relationships appear. The relationship order can
be sorted on the screen  by termgroup rank, source of rel, relationship
attribute, concept name, level and relationship name.</P>
<P>As seen in other screens, if a relationship has a status of N (Needs
Review), it will appear in red in the interface.  If the relationship is a
Suggested relationship, it will appear in blue. These do not need to be edited
unless otherwise directed.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.6.1 New Rel - </B></LI></UL>
<P>A new concept level relationship can be created between two concepts by an
editor.  </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="newrel"></P>
<P>At the bottom of the relationship screen, an editor will see a grey box with
&quot;Concept_id to be linked&quot; in it and an empty white box next to it. 
The editor needs to type in the concept_id of the concept that the relationship
will be created to. Then, the editor needs to click on the &quot;Concept_id to
be linked:&quot; button. This will verify if a valid concept_id has been
entered. The relationship can not be created if the concept_id is not verified.</P>
<P>Then, an editor goes to the New Rel menu option at the top. There is a
picklist to choose which type of relationship will be created. Remember, the
relationship will be created in the direction of the Current Concept to the
linked concept.</P>
<P>Once the relationship has been created, it will appear in the relationship
list as Needs Review (in red). The source of the relationship and the authority
will show the editor's initials.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.6.2 Override Rel -  </B></LI></UL>
<P>The Override Rel command allows an editor to change a concept-level
relationship or to create a concept level relationship from a source level
relationship. For example, if there is a rel linking two concepts by the BT
relationship, the Override rel command can be used to change the rel to RT.</P>
<P>To override a relationship, an editor highlights the relationship and
switches it to Y. Then, the Override Rel menu option at the top is used. The
editor selects the type of relationship and highlights it in the picklist. The
relationship appears as Needs Review (in red). It now has the new type that was
selected.</P>
<P>If an editor wishes to change more than one rel to the same type of
relationship, all of the desired relationships can be switched on and the rels
overridden.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.6.3 Merge - </B></LI></UL>
<P>If an editor sees a relationship to a concept and feels that instead of a
relationship, the concepts should be merged together, the merge can be done from
the Relationship screen. The relationship to the concept is switched on. The
editor will see the concept_id of the concept appear at the bottom of the screen
next to &quot;Concept_id to be merged:&quot;. Once the concept_id appears there,
the Merge menu option is used.  The Current Concept will then reflect the newly
merged concept.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.6.4 Transfer to SEL - </B></LI></UL>
<P>If a relationship row is highlighted, the editor can click the Transfer To
SEL button and the concept will appear on the SEL screen. From here, the concept
can be edited or just looked at. This is a useful feature if editors want to
determine what the concept really means before assigning a relationship type or
if an editor wants to see if a concept could be merged into the Current Concept
instead of being a related  concept.</P>
<P></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.6.5 Show ALL vs. Show WINs - </B></LI></UL>
<P>Currently, the relationships screen shows only those concepts that are &quot;winning
relationships&quot;. A concept could have source rels that are released but not
editable. The source rels may have been cloned to concept level rels and this is
what the editor sees and edits. Occasionally, an editor may want to see all the
relationships that are associated with a concept. If an editor selects the Show
ALL button, all relationships associated with the concept will display.  This
does not mean that an editor can now edit all the concepts displayed. Editors
can only edit the concept level relationships. If an editor wants to go back to
displaying just the winning rels, the Show WINs button can be clicked.</P>
