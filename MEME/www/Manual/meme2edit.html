<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> Reporting Problems to NLM</H3>
<P><STRONG>One important point about all problem reports, please let more than
one person know if there is a problem. Don't just send e-mail or call one person
in case that person is not in the office. The best communication method is
e-mail. Please only use the phone for contract or personal issues or if it is a
real emergency. If it is an emergency, keep calling people until you talk to a
real person and do not leave a message. All this is just to ensure that problems
get fixed if someone is out of the office.</STRONG></P>
<H4>1. Metathesaurus Editing Problem Reports</H4>
<P><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>If you think something is damaging the data, or
something is wrong with a specific concept:  DO NOT EDIT IT.  It is a lot easier
for all of us to diagnose problems if we can see what you saw when you decided
there was a problem and allows us to track the problem.  If the  concept is
edited or data changed, we may not be able to discover what the original problem
was.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI> The first thing an editor should always determine is whether the problem
is an editing site issue or if it is an NLM issue. Problem reports are only sent
to NLM when the problem is an NLM issue. A bad connection at an editing site
does not need to have a problem report sent to NLM but should be dealt with by
the editing site computer support staff. Each editing site should have a
checklist of what to do when there is a problem for their computer support to
follow before anything is sent to NLM.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>If there are any questions about which version of the interface is the most
current and correct,  please check in Meow.
<UL>
<LI>The main screen that first appears when opening the editing
interface contains the interface version information. At the top, the database
to be edited is listed - for example, oa_editing. Since there are multiple
databases at NLM, including the actual editing database, a test database and a
production database, it is important that the correct database for editing is
being used. 
<BR><BR>The next piece of information shown is the editing interface image
date. Again, an editor needs to make sure that the most current image is being
used. An editor can use Meow to check to make sure that the information that
appears on their interface is correct. The home page for Meow
(http://meow.nlm.nih.gov) contains this information near the top under the
Database Information section.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>If you do not have the correct version, send an e-mail to Tammy and Laura
clearly stating that you have an old version of the editing interface. Please
give us the version information you are seeing.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Database problems can come in different forms. They may be data problems,
software problems, version issues, or database issues. All of these types of
problems need to be reported and corrected. Below are guidelines for all editors
to follow in reporting problems.
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>When an editor sends a message concerning problems with editing, please
include the following information:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>the exact error message received</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>where in the interface the problem occurred</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>concept_id(s)  and concept names being worked on</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> interface version</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>editing actions performed at the time of the problem</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>complete worklist name if applicable</STRONG></LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Very Important:</B> If an editor thinks the database is doing something
to corrupt the data, <B>editing should immediately be stopped</B>. A call
should be placed to Tammy and/or Laura and a message should be sent to Tammy,
Laura,  and nlmreg.  Laura can be reached at 301-435-3176, and Tammy can be
reached in the MeSH section at 301-496-1496 and at home (on Fridays) at 
301-362-0407. Please make sure you get an acknowledgment from someone that the
message has been received. Also, the other editors should be told to<B> stop
editing</B> until further instructions are given by NLM. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>Try to link two concepts as REL and the interface makes them XR.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Try to add an STY and the interface deletes all the STYs on a concept even
though you did not use Replace All.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Try to move an atom from one concept to the next and it merges the two
concepts together.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Relationships are created but when the concept report is viewed, the
relationships do not appear.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P></P>  
<UL>
<LI>If an editor is completely unable to perform some editing functions, this
is also important and this information should be e-mailed to us. However, as
long as the data is not being corrupted, editing can continue.  While these
problems will require editors to go back and re-edit concepts once the system is
fixed, they do not prevent all editing. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>Unable to change the concept status to Approved/Reviewed.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Unable to add atom notes.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> Your editing site may have already implemented a problem
reporting procedure that incorporates these guidelines. Please follow any site
procedures for reporting problems to NLM.</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P><BR></P>
<H4>2. MeSH 2000 Problem Reports</H4>
<UL>
<LI>If there is a problem with the MeSH2000 interface, please send a problem
report to Doug Johnston in the MeSH section (douglas_johnston@nlm.nih.gov). Do
not address these problems to the UMLS staff. Please include as much information
in the e-mail message as possible to help Doug diagnose the problem.</LI></UL>
<P><BR></P>
<H4>3. Other problem reports (like Meow, can't find worklist, etc.)</H4>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Meow</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>If there is a problem with a tool on Meow, please report it to Tammy and
Laura. Please send e-mail to both - do not leave a voice mail message. Possible
problems include can't connect to Meow, concept reports do not work, WMS or EMS
is not responding, etc. When reporting the problem, give a detailed explanation
of what is wrong and what has been checked so far to try to solve the problem.
Don't just send a message saying that Meow does not work.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>One hint: If you think that Meow is pointing to the wrong database, refresh
the webpage before reporting the problem. Sometimes a simple refresh will fix
any problems that may be occurring due to cached web pages.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Can't find a worklist</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>If you have been told that a worklist has been sent to your machine and you
can not find it, send a message to both Tammy and Laura. Do not leave a voice
mail message. List which worklist(s) can not be found and where you looked for
it.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Commands for refreshing or printing worklists</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>If you are having problems refreshing or printing worklists, send a message
to Laura and Tammy. Copy and paste the command you entered and what error
message you are getting.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Please let us know if there are <B>any</B> questions. When in doubt,
please contact Tammy and Laura.</LI></UL>
