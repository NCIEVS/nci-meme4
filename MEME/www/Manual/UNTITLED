<LI>When a concept in ICD has an &quot;and&quot; in the concept name, it
generally means &quot;or&quot; for editing purposes. For example, ICD has the
concept &quot;Personal history of allergy to serum and vaccine. Read has the
concept &quot;Personal history of serum or vaccine allergy&quot;. After
examination, it has been determined that these two mean the same thing and can
be merged.<BR></LI></UL><BR>

<LI>Most ICD terms refer to diseases and not organisms.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>ICD 2 digit codes refer to procedures and 3 digit codes refer to diseases.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>ICD V codes should get the STYs of Finding or Population Group. The V codes
should never get any procedure STY. (Added 6/8/99)</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Different V codes should not be merged into the same concept.  Here is an
example of two concept types that were merged together and should not have been.
(Added 6/8/99)<BR>Concept #1 is Contact with communicable diseases (V##). 
Concept #2 is Contact with unspecified communicable disease (V##.#). Even though
these concepts appear to follow the X can be merged with X,NOS rule, these
concepts should be kept separate. Concept #1 is plural and means class. Concept
#2 is singular and means one disease (that is just not specified).</LI></UL>

<li>ICD E codes
<pre>
The ICD9 E codes all have source codes that begin with the letter E and are a 
special part of ICD9. According to the ICD documentation, the E codes are:

"This section is provided to permit the classification of environmental events, 
circumstances, and conditions as the cause of injury, poisoning, and other 
adverse effects.  Where a code from this section is applicable, it is intended 
that it shall be used in addition to a code from one of the main chapters of 
ICD-9-CM, indicating the nature of the condition."

IT has been decided by NLM, that the E codes should be taken on face value. They
can either be referring to the actual injury or to the cause of the injury. If
it refers to the cause, the type should be assigned based on the cause and not
the injury that may result.

When looking at a concept, take the head noun and assign an STY based on that.
For example:

Accident by Methane - the head noun is accident so the type would be Phen. or 
Process
Tylenol causing adverse effects - the head noun is Tylenol so the type would be
Pharmacologic Substance
Fire of Prairie - fire is the head noun and the type is Phen or Process




Some examples:

**The STY for this should be: Phenomenon or Process
The accident itself is a phenomenon and not the actual injury.
