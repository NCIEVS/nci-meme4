<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Drug Sources and Plants</H3>
<p>We have decided that the drug sources (NDDF, Micromedix, Multum, etc.) do
not contain plants, they contain plant preparations. In addition, the
MeSH SCRs should not contain plants. If you see a string that appears to
be identical to a plant from any of these sources, they should not be in the 
same concept as atoms that do mean plant. Once split out they should receive the 
STYs "Organic Chemical" &"Pharmacologic Substance". If it is a multi-meaning the 
PN for the Plant should be just the name of the plant. The preparation will be 
"XXXXX Preparation". 
<p>The Altlink homeopathic preparations may be merged
with these. One could argue that they really aren't the same and should
appear in their own concept. Stuart has agreed we should merge them in order to 
prevent too many meanings for a given string that are not useful.
