Mapping of Deleted CUIs
<p><u>Background</u>
<p>CUIs are the unique concept identifier. The identifier remains the same
across versions of the Metathesaurus irrespective of the term designated
as the preferred name of the concept. This facilitates file maintenance
and management. In the Metathesaurus distribution formats, all data elements
are linked to the concept(s) to which they belong.
<p>If a CUI no longer exists in the Metathesaurus, that means that the
meaning is no longer in the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; In same cases you will
find that the meaning still exists in the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; If in fact
it doesn't exist, we want to find the concept(s) that has the closest meaning
to the CUI that was deleted.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>The Task</u>
<p>You will be given Excel files that contain CUIs that have been deleted
from the Metathesaurus.
<p>Each worksheet contains six columns as described below:
<p>The first column is the Version.&nbsp; This is the last version of the
Metathesaurus that the concept Appeared in.&nbsp; This information is supplied
by NLM.
<p>Deleted CUI is the CUI that has been deleted.&nbsp; If you click on
this, it will take you to the concept report in the release files.&nbsp;
Remember, the release file reports do not look the same as the ones in
Meow that you are used to seeing from the mid. This information is supplied
by NLM.
<p>P/PF-This is the concept name for the CUI that was deleted. This information
is supplied by NLM.
<p>REL-This is the relationship between the deleted CUI and the one that
it best matches in the Metathesaurus. The default supplied by NLM is "unassigned".&nbsp;
Below you will see a description of the possible choices.&nbsp; You will
need to pick the best relationship.&nbsp; This must be completed.
<p>Matched CUI- This is the CUI that you feel is best related to the deleted
CUI.&nbsp; The software will create a link to the release files after you
add this.
<p>Match P/PF - You DO NOT need to fill this in.&nbsp; In some cases there
is a suggested CUI.&nbsp; In those cases the concept name will appear.
<p>Comments - This if for you to fill out if you have any comments or questions.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Your job will be to to relate the deleted CUI to at least one CUI that
currently exists in the Metathesaurus.&nbsp; In addition you will need
to pick one of the following relationship below other than unassigned.
<p>--unassigned--this is the default and implies the editor has not worked
on this concept.
<br>--Synonym--
<br>--has NRW REL to--
<br>--has BRD REL to--
<br>--Other--Concept 1 has some relationship to concept 2
<br>--No match--The editor picks this on the RARE occasion that they cannot
find ANY concept that could even be generally related to the deleted concept
within the allotted time. These will have to be re-edited.
<br>--Not Mappable--Where concept 1 is not a useful biomedical concept
and is not mappable to any current UMLS concept (e.g., &amp;nbsp; in PDQ).&nbsp;
We anticipate that you will find very few if any of these on your worksheets.
<p>Start by clicking on the highlighted CUI to view the concept report
from the release files.&nbsp; Look at the concepts in MRREL.&nbsp; These
are the concepts that were related to the deleted one in the release files.&nbsp;
You will probably find the best relationships here.
<p>If that doesn't yield a good match, try using the approximate matching
in Meow.&nbsp; For this, use the mid instead of the release files.&nbsp;
This is probably going to be better than using norm searching or lc searching
in the mid.
<p>Check to make sure you are mapping to a CUI that is still alive. (Use
the history button)
<br>Do NOT spend more than 10 minutes on any concept.&nbsp; After 10 minutes
choose "no match".
<br>Use Ctrl-W to close browser windows.&nbsp; It can get confusing if
you leave too many open so close them frequently.
<br>You may assign a deleted CUI to more than one live CUI.&nbsp; You will
need to insert an additional row in the spreadsheet.
<p>When you copy and paste, only copy from left to right, not right to
left.&nbsp; If you copy from right to left, it will mess up the cells.
<p><b><u>How to choose the best CUI to map your deleted CUI to:</u></b>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a living concept in the Metathesaurus that has the
same meaning?
<br>We found many cases where a source killed something because it contained
a typo.
<p>For example:
<p>LOINC had GLASCOW COMA SCORE.EYE OPENING
<br>this died but they created GLASGOW COMA SCORE.EYE OPENING
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2.&nbsp; If there is no synonymous concept, try to map to the same source
first, prefering the parent.
<p>For example:&nbsp; C0498076
<br>ONLAY-COMPOSITE/RESIN-PER TOOTH (IN ADDITION TO INLAY-LABORATORY PROCESSED)
<p>is NRW than
<p>C0498076&nbsp; Inlay/Onlay Restorations
<p>Both of these concepts were from HCPCs.&nbsp; C0498076 is a Hierarchical
term from the section that C0498076 came from.
<p>3.&nbsp; Choose something broader rather than close in meaning when
possible.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4.&nbsp; If the meaning appears to be mapped to any single reasonable
CUI then do not map to multiple CUIs.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Or if the meaning cannot be mapped to any reasonble CUI than map to
multiple CUIs.
<p>5.&nbsp; Choose simple (&amp; general) as opposed to complex precoordinated
expression or multple CUIs.
<p>Examples:
<p>C0498890 INJECTION, HISTAMINE, UP TO 2.75 MG&nbsp; OTHER C0019588 HISTAMINE
<p>C0499279&nbsp; INTERMITTENT URINARY CATHETER, DISPOSABLE; STRAIGHT TIP
<br>is NRW than
<br>C0497833. INTERMITTENT URINARY CATHETER; STRAIGHT TIP, EACH
<p>LOWER GI TRACE - C0489859
<br>OTHER
<br>C0489144 STOOLS:APPEARANCE:POINT IN TIME:LOWER GI TRACE:QUALITATIVE
<p>C0369194 ESTRIOLS.TOTAL
<br>Synonym
<br>C0014927&nbsp; Estriol
<br>Note:&nbsp; This was from LOINC which had it related to:
<br>C0364383 ESTRIOL.TOTAL:MASS CONCENTRATION:POINT IN TIME:AMNIOTIC FLUID:QUANTITATIVE
<br>that concept name has been changed to:
<br>ESTRIOL:MASS CONCENTRATION:POINT IN TIME:AMNIOTIC FLUID:QUANTITATIVE
<p>C0500278 IMMUNOASSAY, INFECTIOUS AGENT ANTIGEN, QUALITATIVE OR SEMIQUANTITATIVE
<br>&nbsp;is BRD than two CUIs
<br>C0373856&nbsp; IMMUNOASSAY FOR INFECTIOUS AGENT ANTIGEN, QUALITATIVE
OR SEMIQUANTITATIVE;MULTIPLE STEP METHOD
<br>and
<br>C0520389 IMMUNOASSAY FOR&nbsp; INFECTIOUS AGENT ANTIGEN, QUALITATIVE
OR SEMIQUANTITATIVE; SINGLE STEP&nbsp; METHOD (EG, REAGENT STRIP)
