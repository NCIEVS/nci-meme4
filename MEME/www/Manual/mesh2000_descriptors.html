<br>Example: <b>C0005049</b>. Similar to the <a href="#MUI">MUI</a>, which
is the concept identifier created by M2000. The CUI is not always available,
for example, newly created concepts in M2000 will not yet have a corresponding
CUI.) Also note that in some cases different MUIs may map to the same CUI.

<li>
<a NAME="DC"></a><b>DC</b> (Descriptor Class)</li>

<br>Description: Categories that affect whether a term is published in
<i>Index Medicus</i>, etc. In most Descriptors the DC = 1. All Descriptors
are searchable in NLM's online MeSH-indexed databases but only DC=1 are
printed in <i>Index Medicus</i>. Geographical Descriptors (DC=4) have Tree
Numbers (<a href="#MN">MN</a>) and so appear in <i>MeSH Tree Structures</i>.
Note that the DC value affects the <a href="permute.htm">rules</a> permutation
of terms. Neither Publication Types (DC=2) nor Check Tags (DC=3) have tree
numbers and so are not published in the <i>MeSH Tree Structures</i>. There
are four possible DC values:
<ul><b>1</b> = Index Medicus Descriptor, the only class printed in <i>Index
Medicus</i>.
<br><b>2</b> = Publication Types, for example, 'Review [Publication Type]'.
<br><b>3</b> = Check Tag, e.g., 'Male' (no tree number)
<br><b>4</b> = Geographic Descriptor (Z category of tree number); not in
<i>Index Medicus</i>.</ul>
How input: Manually

<br>
<li>
<a NAME="EC"></a><b>EC</b> or <b>EC_UI</b> (Entry Combination)</li>

<br>Description: Descriptor to be used for indexing instead of the prohibited
combination of the current Descriptor and Qualifier in the associated <a href="#SHIN">SHIN</a>
field. For example, in the Descriptor for 'Heart', the EC refers to <b>Echocardiography</b>
and the Qualifier referred to in the SHIN is 'ultrasonography'. This means
that the combination of 'Heart' and 'ultrasonography' is prohibited but
instead 'Echocardiography' should be used. The allowable Descriptor may
also be a Descriptor/Qualifier combination, in which case the optional
<a href="#SHOUT">SHOUT</a> field is used to specify the Qualifier. For
example, in the 'Heart' Descriptor, instead of the combination 'Heart/chemistry',
the combination to be used is 'Myocardium/chemistry' so the SHOUT value
refers to the Qualifier for 'chemistry'. The Descriptor name (=term) is
used to display the EC field but the actual value of the EC is the Descriptor
<a href="#UI">UI</a>), for example, <b>D006321</b>, as are other fields
in MeSH200 that refer to a Descriptor. How input: Manually, in a text box.
The term that names the Descriptor may be input as well as entry terms
and the Descriptor UI. See User assistance, below.
<br>Repeating field: yes
<br>Required field: no
<br>Validation: Must contain a current Descriptor UI and display the current
Descriptor name (= MH).
<br>User assistance: Entered string is automatically converted to the Descriptor
name if the string matches an <a href="#EP">EP</a>, <a href="#EN">EN</a>,
or <a href="#EV">EV</a>. This is triggered when the ENTER key is pressed
or the <i>Tools|MH Lookup</i> menu is selected.

<a NAME="PT"></a><b>PT</b> (Permuted Term)</li>

<br>Description: Alpha-numeric string which is the term itself that is
automatically generated from manually entered <a href="#Term">Terms</a>.
(See <a href="permute.htm">Permuted Term Rules</a>.) A PT is tied to a
specific manually entered term, so if the term is deleted, the PT is also
deleted. (Unlike MESH204 in which the PT depended only on the Descriptor.)
A PT value is not treated as a term - it is excluded - if the adjacent
<a href="#PTX">PTX</a> check box is checked.
<br>Example: <b>Arrest, Cardiac</b>
<br>Edit label: PT
<br>Print label: PT
<br>How input: Automatically.
<br>Repeating field: yes
<br>Required field: no
<br>Validation: Cannot be duplicated by another term, whether in a <a href="#Term">Descriptor</a>,

Concept Record</a>, or by an <a href="#EV">EV</a>.

<a NAME="PTX"></a><b>PTX</b> (PT eXcluded)</li>

<br>Description: Checkbox label in the MeSH2000 client indicating that
the PT is excluded as a term. The PTX is also used to refer to the excluded
term itself. In the underlying table, the marked PT term does not go away
but is marked so as not be used as data for any purposes. (Note that when
the PTX is checked, the column PTFLAG = "Y".) A PTX is tied to a specific
manually entered term from which the PT was generated, so if the term is
deleted, the PTX is also deleted. (Unlike MESH204 in which the PTX depended
only on the Descriptor.)

<br>Description: For provisional records in New MeSH the RA is the three-character
user name of the user authorizing the record. In current MeSH, since there
is no separate step of authorization, the RA is the user name of the user
who is modifying or creating the record and is then derived from the <a href="#Ownerid">Ownerid</a>.
