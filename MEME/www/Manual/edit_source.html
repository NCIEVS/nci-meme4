<LI><B>CPT</B>
<UL>
<LI>There should never be a situation where a CPT code should be in a different
concept from the same HCPCS code. Therefore, a CPT atom and a HCPCS atom with
the same code should always be in the same concept.  (From a 3/18/99 e-mail from
WTH)</LI></UL>

<LI>There should never be a situation where more than one CPT OR HCPCS code
should be in the same concept.</LI></UL></LI></UL>

<LI><B>Dorland</B>
<UL>
<LI>A couple of years ago, Dorland was added into the Metathesaurus. Some of
the definitions were reviewed when they merged into a concept for accuracy. Some
definitions were not good matches and were marked as not to be released. They
were never matched to the correct concepts. Then,  for legal reasons, it was
determined that we could not release Dorland  and every Dorland atom was marked
as  not to be released (they are enclosed in {}). So, there may be Dorland atoms
and definitions that do not match the concept they are in. <STRONG>Editors
should not edit Dorland atoms</STRONG>. NLM is in the process of deciding
whether to remove them from the database all together.</LI></UL></LI></UL>

<LI><B>ICD</B>
<UL>
<LI>When a concept in ICD has an &quot;and&quot; in the concept name, it
generally means &quot;or&quot; for editing purposes. For example, ICD has the
concept &quot;Personal history of allergy to serum and vaccine. Read has the
concept &quot;Personal history of serum or vaccine allergy&quot;. After
examination, it has been determined that these two mean the same thing and can
be merged.<BR>See also Read 1998 discussion of V terms below.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Most ICD terms refer to diseases and not organisms. The exception to this
are the Index terms (IT). These terms can refer to organisms.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>ICD 2 digit codes refer to procedures and 3 digit codes refer to diseases.</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>ICD V codes should get the STYs of Finding or Population Group. The V codes
should never get any procedure STY. (Added 6/8/99)</LI></UL><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Different V codes should not be merged into the same concept.  Here is an
example of two concept types that were merged together and should not have been.
(Added 6/8/99)<BR>Concept #1 is Contact with communicable diseases (V##). 
Concept #2 is Contact with unspecified communicable disease (V##.#). Even though
these concepts appear to follow the X can be merged with X,NOS rule, these
concepts should be kept separate. Concept #1 is plural and means class. Concept
#2 is singular and means one disease (that is just not specified).</LI></UL></LI></UL>

<LI>The letters CA (or Ca) can refer to either cancer or carcinoma. Atoms with
the letters Ca should only be merged with cancer or carcinoma when there is
adequate source information defining the intended meaning of Ca. Some Read
thesaurus Optional Preferred (OP) terms have only the letters Ca and an
associated body part (e.g. Ca Gallbladder) and do not specify the intended
meaning of Ca. In this situation, pending clarification from Read, Ca should not
be merged with either carcinoma or cancer. (Carcinoma is a subtype of cancer
that arises from epithelial tissue and carcinoma is generally not viewed as a
synonym for cancer. Cancer is synonymous with the terms malignant neoplasms and
malignant tumors).</LI></UL><BR>

<LI>
<P>It is believed that all 'bracket terms' have the apparent meaning of the
RCDSY terms (which strip the bracketed letters) - <B>EXCEPT</B> the [V] terms.</P>
<P>[V] terms AND all ICD9 V codes AND all ICD10 codes under 'Factors
influencing health status and contact with health services' MAY have <B>DIFFERENT</B>
meanings from the apparent meaning and should be Multiple Meanings in those
cases.</P>
<P>The classic example is: </P>
<PRE>'V01.0 Cholera'
which means 
  'V01  Contact with or exposure to communicable diseases'
       'V01.0 Cholera'
or 'Contact with or exposure to cholera'</PRE>
<P>This example is currently edited and has a good PN; see CN# 467108.</P>
<P>The RCDSYs must always travel with the [V] terms they are made from. They
have to be edited with the knowledge that they well mean the something other
than the apparent meaning of the string.</P>
<P>In many cases, the 'stripped' RCDSY versions are involved in demotions. This
is unfortunate but correct because each of these cases needs editing and the
demotions will force that.</P>
<PRE>Definitions from Sources:

Read [V] terms; ICD-9 V codes; 
ICD10 'Factors influencing health status and contact with health services'
------------------------------------------------------------
[V] and all ICD V codes are 'Health Status and contact with health 
services factors' in Read;  the ICD-9-CM manual says:

  'This classification is provided to deal with occasions when 
   circumstances other than a disease or injury classifiable 
   to categories 001-999 (the main part of ICD) are recorded as
   &quot;diagnoses or &quot;problems.&quot; 

and goes on to list cases where a person not currently sick 
needs: 

  a) prohylactic vaccination, to discuss a problem which is not a 
     disease or injury, etc.;
  b) when a person is receiving treatment (e.g. dialysis for 
     renal disease, chemotherapy for malignancy, cast change
  c) circumstance which  which influences health status
     but is not a disease or injury.

<UL>
<LI>Read98 uses  the code PT to represent Preferred Term and SY to represent
Synonymous  terms. Read views the separate PT's as being truly distinct
entities. Read also views the PT/SY relationships of the same code as being
truly  synonymous. In general, editors should not split Read SY's from their 
PT's unless there is a strong biomedical justification. Read also has OP's 
which represent optional or obsolete terms. These may be merged with PT's  as
discussed previously. Terms that are viewed as synonyms to OP's are  assigned as
IS (synonymous term to OP of the same code).  Editors should use their own
discretion  when editing IS's in Read98, since the relationship between OP and
IS terms may not be as consistently synonymous as the relationship between  PT
and SY terms.</LI></UL></LI></UL>

<LI><B>SNMI</B>
<UL>
<LI> SNMI97 mappings to ICD-9-CM were released in Meta98 MRREL as
source-specific SNMI97 &quot;LK&quot; rels. The decision was made that we trust
Snomed for the relationships.  Therefore, they appear in MEME-II as source level
Reviewed Relationships. Editors do not need to edit these.
<P>There is one exception to editing these relationships. If it is found that
the LK relationships are synonymous with the concept they are related to, they
can be merged into the concept. Otherwise, the relationships do not need to be
touched.</P></LI></UL></LI></UL>
