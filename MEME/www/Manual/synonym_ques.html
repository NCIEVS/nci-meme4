<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> Are toxicity and poisoning synonymous in the
Metathesaurus?
<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> Concepts involving toxicity and poisoning are close to
being synonymous but are not 100%. Therefore, do not considered them synonymous
unless a source indicates that they are in the context of the concepts.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> Are sequela and late effects SY?
<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> These are similar concepts but are not synonymous. Sequela
can refer to short effects.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> Are drugs and agents synonymous?
<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> In most cases, an agent causing adverse effects and a drug
of the same name as agent causing adverse effects can be merged together.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> Can MeSH Publication Types and Main Headings be merged as
one concept?
<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> 
<strong>Note:</strong> As of July 2001, this policy has changed. Publication Types
are not to be merged with Main Headings. They will be kept as separate concepts
and given PNs.
<p><strong>Old policy</strong>: Publication Types (DC = 2 ) can be  merged with Main
Headings (DC = 1) when they match lexically and the editors agree that they are
naming the same thing.  I think the Pub Type distinction is really one of usage,
not of meaning.
