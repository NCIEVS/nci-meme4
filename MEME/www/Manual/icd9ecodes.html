E Codes in ICD9


The ICD9 E codes all have source codes that begin with the letter E and are a 
special part of ICD9. According to the ICD documentation, the E codes are:

&quot;This section is provided to permit the classification of environmental events, 
circumstances, and conditions as the cause of injury, poisoning, and other 
adverse effects.  Where a code from this section is applicable, it is intended 
that it shall be used in addition to a code from one of the main chapters of 
ICD-9-CM, indicating the nature of the condition.&quot;

IT has been decided by NLM, that the E codes should be taken on face value. They
can either be referring to the actual injury or to the cause of the injury. If
it refers to the cause, the type should be assigned based on the cause and not
the injury that may result.

When looking at a concept, take the head noun and assign an STY based on that.
For example:

Accident by Methane - the head noun is accident so the type would be Phen. or 
Process
Tylenol causing adverse effects - the head noun is Tylenol so the type would be
Pharmacologic Substance
Fire of Prairie - fire is the head noun and the type is Phen or Process




Some examples:

**The STY for this should be: Phenomenon or Process
The accident itself is a phenomenon and not the actual injury.
