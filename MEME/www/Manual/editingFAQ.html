<HR>
<P>Welcome to the Metathesaurus Editing Information page.  This page will try
to answer questions posed by the UMLS Metathesaurus editors. As new questions
emerge, this page will be updated with new information which will eventually be
placed in the editing manual. Please contact
<A HREF="mailto:powell@nlm.nih.gov">Tammy Powell</A> or
<A HREF="mailto:lad@nlm.nih.gov">Laura Roth</A> if there are any questions or
concerns.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Editing Source Level Relationships (8/31/99)</B></LI></UL>
<P>Editors should not edit source level relationships. They come directly from
a  source and will be attributed to that source upon release. Even if you do not
 agree with the rel, do not edit it. All that will do is create a concept level 
relationship that will be attributed to the Metathesaurus. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the source level rels exist in the concept reports to provide
 information to editors and to provide connections between main heading and
entry  terms in sources.  
</P>
<P>The only time source level rels should be edited is if an editor is told to 
specifically in an editing task. Right now, none of the worklists require this.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>RT? relationships (8/31/99)</B></LI></UL>
<P>Sometimes, relationships are inserted with a relationship type of RT?. This
means that the correct relationship could not be determined during insertion. If
an editor feels the relationship should be something other than Related, the
relationship can be edited as normal. If an editor thinks the relationship
should be Related, no action needs to be taken. Upon approval or stamping, RT?
relationships become REL (related) relationships.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>**New rules for editing of atoms enclosed in {} (6/18/99)</B></LI></UL>
<P>Atoms that are set as &quot;not to be released&quot; are enclosed in curly
brackets '{}' on concept reports. They also appear in the Classes Screen on the
editing interface in green. NLM has made a change to the editing policy for
these atoms.</P>
<P>In the past, we have told editors that they could generally ignore the atoms
that are marked as tbr=n (the green atoms in the classes screen or the ones in
{} on concept reports) when doing splits or merges. These atoms are usually old
versions of a source that we have not removed from the database yet (like
RCD95).</P>
<P>NLM has always asserted in its release files that a CUI stays with the same
concept through its life. NLM has started to implement new ways to ensure that
the same CUI stays with the appropriate concepts throughout the concept's
history. We have discovered that not editing the green atoms can cause some
errors in CUI maintenance.
</P>
<P>Therefore, we would like editors to start splitting out the green atoms when
appropriate. Editors can treat the tbr=n atoms the same as atoms that are
released. For example, in the concept below:</P>

             R         Composer [SNM2/PT/J-17120] 
             R         {Composer [RCD98/PT/0451.]} 
             R []  Composer - music [RCD99/SY/0451.] 
             R         {Composer - music [RCD98/SY/0451.]} 
             R []  Musical composer NOS [RCD99/OP/045Z.] 
             R         {Musical composer NOS [RCD98/OP/045Z.]} 
</PRE>
<P>Say you as an editor decided that &quot;musical composer NOS&quot; should be
split out (I know this is not the case but this is just an example). In the
past, an editor could just split out the RCD99 atom and not worry about the
RCD98 atom. Now, we would like an editor to split out both atoms into a new
concept. We don't want to leave the RCD98 residue behind. 
</P>
<P>It is very easy to make sure this is accomplished. When an editor is in the
classes screen, do a sort of the atoms by Code or source. This will group the
atoms and clearly show which atoms need to stay together.  As mentioned before,
we already have told editors that they can merge concepts with only tbr=n atoms
in order to solve demotions.  If ANY of this is not clear, please let NLM know
before trying to edit these kind of concepts.</P>
<P>The only exception to this is the Dorland atoms. Editors still do not need
to worry about these atoms. If a concept ONLY has Dorland atoms in the wrong
place, just leave them and don't worry about them. If an editor has a concept
where they are splitting out other atoms and a Dorland atom is also present,
then an editor can include it in a split. Basically, NLM does not want editors
to spend time on Dorland atoms that are by themselves since they have lost all
meaning long ago. In the Example below, an editor would not have to worry about
moving the Dorland atom:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Proposed new Clinical Drug definition and usage</B> (added 4/23/99)</LI></UL>
<PRE>Currently Clinical Drug is defined as:

 A pharmaceutical preparation as produced by the manufacturer. The name usually
includes the substance, its strength, and the form, but may include the 
substance and only one of the other two items. 

So if you read the definition you think something like:  Valium Pill is
a Clinical Drug, Valium is not, and neither is Sleeping Pill (since it
doesn't include the substance). Oral Valium gives you the substance but not
the strength or form so under the current definition that wouldn't be clinical
drug.

Stuart and I talked about this and we decided that the official definition 
of Clinical Drug needs to be broadened.  Below I have a proposed new definition.
Even though we don't have an official new definition, you should type concepts
as though we have already approved a new, broadened form of it.

New Proposed Def:
A pharmaceutical preparation as produced by the manufacturer.  The name may
include only the form or the substance, its strength, route, and the form, but
may include the substance and only one of the other three items.

Usage Note:
Do not double type with Pharmacologic Substance, Antibiotic, or other
chemical semantic types. If the name only contains the substance such as
Diazepam, do not use &quot;Clinical Drug&quot;.

Here are some examples of things that should be clinical drug that may not
currently have that type:  

Eye Drops, Tablets, Capsules, Oral Valium

There's a large section of MeSH called &quot;Dosage Forms&quot; and most of that
will need to be changed from &quot;Pharmacologic Substance&quot; to &quot;Clinical Drug&quot;

STY page on Meow will be updated to reflect these additions.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Atoms enclosed in {} or marked as NEVER (revised 6/18/99)</B>
<P>Atoms that are set as &quot;not to be released&quot; are enclosed in curly
brackets '{}' on concept reports. They also appear in the Classes Screen on the
editing interface in green. Atoms that are set for deletion appear with the word
NEVER next to them on concept reports but do not appear in the editing
interface.</P>
<P>Atoms set for deletion are NEVER edited. They are going to be removed from
the database entirely at some point in the future. Concepts tagged as not to be
released are still in the database but are not released when the Metathesaurus
is produced. As a rule, if a concept is from an older version of a source where
a newer version has been inserted, the atoms from the old version are marked as
not to be released.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Merging concepts that include a group and a group with examples</B>
<P>In general, concepts that name  a group of items (e.g. Fruits) should be
merged with concepts that also refer to the same group of items but also include
specific examples (e.g. Fruits, including apples). Adding an example does not
change the meaning of the concept.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Synonymy of concepts with NOS, unspecified, site not specified, etc.</B>
<PRE>Disease X , Disease X, Site unspecified, Disease X, unspecified, and Disease X, NOS are viewed in the
Metathesaurus as synonyms and should be merged together. 

I think you will find that most (or at least enough) make the case
that these &quot;Site Unspecified&quot; names come from vocabularies like the
ICDs which require coding at the leaf, so they repeat the parent's
meaning by adding &quot;NOS&quot; or &quot;Site Unspecified&quot;.

An example of atoms from a concept that follows this rule is provided below: 

Benign Neoplasm
Benign Neoplasm, NOS ('NOS' refers to 'Not Otherwise Specified')
Benign neoplasm of unspecified site (or Benign Neoplasm, Site Unspecified)
Benign neoplasm, unspecified.</PRE></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Concepts with matching strings that do not merge</B>
<P>When editors find two concepts that have  matching strings that were not
automatically merged after an insertion, they should inform NLM (especially if
an editor sees a pattern of non-merges occurring). There may be a valid
explanation as to why the two were not merged, but this may also represent a
software error that merits further evaluation.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>ATXs</B>
<P>ATXs refer to Associated Expressions. They are not current and new ones are
not being added at this time so editors can ignore them when editing.  The
history of ATXs is that 4-5 years ago editors mapped MeSH to other sources like
ICD.  ATXs were used to represent this mapping but problems with resources and
software prevented the project from continuing.  So, editors do not need to
worry about ATXs when editing.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Dorland's</B>
<P>A couple of years ago, Dorland was added into the Metathesaurus. Some of the
definitions were reviewed when they merged into a concept for accuracy. Some
definitions were not good matches and were marked as not to be released. They
were never matched to the correct concepts. Then,  for legal reasons, it was
determined that we could not release Dorland  and every Dorland atom was marked
as  not to be released (they are enclosed in {}). So, there may be Dorland atoms
and definitions that do not match the concept they are in. <STRONG>Editors
should not edit Dorland atoms</STRONG>. NLM is in the process of deciding
whether to remove them from the database all together.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Stamping vs. Approval</B>
<P>When an editor gets a worklist, they can do all the editing on paper. If
nothing needs to be changed on a concept, the editor does not need to go into
the editing interface and manually approve concepts. When the worklist is
stamped, the concepts will automatically be approved unless something has
changed in the concept since the time the editor was assigned the worklist (ex.
an insertion was done and a new atom was inserted in a concept after an editor
received the worklist). If something has changed in the concept since the editor
has been assigned the worklist, the concept will stay as Needs Review and will
show up on another worklist. An editor does not have to worry about going back
and looking at the concept again.</P>
<P>If a concept on a worklist needs changing, the editor has to go into the
editing interface. Once the changes are made, an editor <B>MUST</B> Approve the
concept. When a concept is approved, the editor is responsible for everything
that is in the concept. Before approval, an editor needs to check all atoms,
relationships, STYs, etc. in the concept. An approval means that an editor feels
that everything is okay  in the concept. If an editor has a question about
something, the concept should not be approved.</P>
<P>If an editor edits a concept that was not on a worklist, the editor needs to
manually Approve the concept. The stamping mechanism will not pick up concepts
that are not on a worklist so automatic approval can not occur.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Definition of STY - Untyped</B>
<P>This STY was originally created for editors to assign to concepts when they
had no idea what STY to use. It was <EM>not</EM> meant to be used when a
decision could not be made between two STYs. This STY was a way to indicate that
someone had looked at the concept and did not know what to assign it. This has
not been used for the past several years.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Definition of IMN</B>
<P>IMN is an internal MeSH note used by the MeSH staff. It is a way for them to
store information that is not seen by the public (similar to meta notes/concept
notes/atom notes). </P>
<P>Examples: If a thesaurus specialist goes to a lot of trouble to verify a
definition or consult an expert in the field on a controversial subject, this
information may be included.  There is also information to indicate
relationships between entry terms since the current MeSH maintenance system does
not allow this. </P>
<P>Only concepts in the Metathesaurus that contain atoms from MeSH descriptors
will have this field. IMNs can be viewed from the Concept screen in the editing
interface (if an IMN exists, the button will be red) and are also printed on the
concept reports.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Atom Note vs. Meta Note vs. Concept Note</B>
<P>Meta Notes were used in MEME-I as a way for an editor to supply information
about a concept that should not been seen by the public but should be seen by
the editors. For MEME-II, these will become Concept Notes. Information in a
Concept Note will stay with the concept.</P>
<P>Atom Notes are notes about a specific atom as opposed to a Concept Note
which is about the entire concept. Atom Notes will stay with the atom that they
are attached to. If an atom is split out of a concept, the note will go with it.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating and Saving an Edit List File</B>
<P>Edit list files can be created from concepts that are in the Select Frame. 
</P>
<P>Begin by transferring all concepts you wish to have in your edit list, into
SEL.  Then click on Save: Edit List to File.  You will receive a prompt to type
in the name for the file.  After you type in the name, click 'OK&quot;. 
</P>
<P>When you are ready to edit the file again, bring up the SEL frame. Type in
the Name of the file next to &quot;Read Edit List from file&quot; then  click on
&quot;Add&quot;.  The file will be transferred back to SEL. 
</P>
<P>Note: You must use the same machine to retrieve the file that you saved it
on.  The file is saved to the hard drive of the machine you are working on.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Search using Finder</B>
<P>When using Finder, the search terms entered need to be at least 3 letters.
If less than 3 are used, no results are displayed. Also, Finder does not use any
type of wildcard.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Prompt for more than 100 Rels</B>
<P>If a concept has more than 100 relationships, a pop-up message appears
asking if all of the relationships should be displayed. If not, the default of
100 are shown.</P>
<P>This option was implemented because of the time it can take to load more
than 100 relationships. It is recommended that all of the Rels be viewed only if
the editor is working on relationships. Otherwise, an editor should choose to
view only 100.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Pop-up messages</B>
<P>When  a pop-up message appears on the screen, please acknowledge it. These
messages are usually prompts for actions to be taken or error messages.  Please
make sure to read what the message says. Usually, clicking on OK will make the
message disappear. </P>
<P>If the pop-up message is not acknowledged and another screen is brought to
the front, the pop-up message will still be waiting  in the background and will
not allow editing to occur.</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>ICD91/MX</B>
<P>ICD91/MX Matching term: These terms were created purely for matching
purposes and  are not released. ICD/MX terms are chemicals like &quot;XYZ&quot;
whose atoms were generated   from REAL ICD terms like &quot;Poisoning by XYZ&quot;.
The MX term has an RT relationship to  the REAL ICD term ... and is used purely
for matching (MXing) to REAL chemical atoms  in other sources. (This information
is also in the ICD Source information page.)</P></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>Concepts with no STYs or Atoms (marked with NEVER)</B>
<P>There are some concepts that are not going to be released and are marked for
removal. They are marked with the word &quot;NEVER&quot; next to the atoms (as
seen on the concept report).  This means this atom is on death row and is never
going to be released.  Therefore, there is <B>no</B> point in editing it
because it will die.</P></LI></UL>
