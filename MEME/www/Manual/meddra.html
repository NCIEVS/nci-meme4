<PRE>MedDRA Editing Guidelines


MeddRA is an international medical terminology. It is applicable to all phases 
of drug development,including animal toxicology. It is also applicable to the 
health effects of devices (e.g. uteric ruptureafter iud insertion; infection 
because of failure to sterilize a catheter). 

The termgroups that exist in MedDRA are as follows:


System Organ Class      OS 
  
High Level Group term   HG  
  
High Level term         HT  
  
Preferred term          PT  
 
Lower Level term        LT 

Non-current LLT   	OL 

Special Search Cat.     SC </pre>    

<b>Specific Editing Tips:</b>


<p>1. There are no chemical concepts in MedDRA. Therefore, MedDRA atoms should
never be in a chemical concept. If you see a MedDRA string, like Calcium, it 
really is referring to a test for calcium or something similar. So, it should
be merged with the appropriate non-chemical concept. 

<p>2. In almost all cases we decided that &quot;mumble (all forms)&quot; was equivalent
to &quot;mumble&quot;. 

<p>3. Semantic Types - We assigned default semantic types to the HT MedDRA 
termgroup in cases where MedDRA didn't merge with other sources. In some 
cases, default semantic types were also assigned further down the hierarchy.  
The HTs should be correct. However, there are cases where the inheritance may 
be incorrect and the STYs may need to be changed. In addition, the MedDRA LTs 
inherited STYs from the PTs and they also may be incorrect. If they are wrong, 
an editor can change the STY(s) to the appropriate one(s).

<br>
<br>Please remember not to spend time changing closely related STYs, like
changing between Sign or Symptom, Finding, or Disease.... If there are questions
about this, please ask. If an editor finds a large section of a worklist that
seems to need STY changes, please let NLM know before the changes are made in
the editing interface.

<p>4. When editing the MedDRA relationships from the PTs, editors may find LTs that 
are not EQV to the PTs but EQV to each other. These should be merged. An example
is (some of the report has been cut out):

NEEDS REVIEW RELATED CONCEPT(S)
[RT?]  FSH increased [MDR99/LT||MDR99|MDR99] {2194655} C
[RT?]  Follicle stimulating hormone increased [MDR99/LT||MDR99|MDR99] {14572} C
</pre>
<p>These two MDR99/LTs are synonymous and can be merged. They are not synonymous
with the concept they are related to though.

<p>5. For concepts that involve different types of pregnancy complications, they
should be typed as both Finding and Pathologic Function.

<p>6. For the laboratory tests in MedDRA, an editor may see Diazepam with a LT of
Valium.  Even though Valium is not eqv to diazepam within the context of drugs,
in MedDRA diazepam means diazepam assay and valium means diazepam assay.  We
believe it is safe to assume they don't run a different test for the trade and 
the generic so these two need would be merged together.

<p>7. In some cases, the OLs are obviously typos of a PT ot LT. These should be
merged.

<p>8. For laboratory tests. . . The test for the acid is probably equivalent to
the test for the ester.  For example, pyruvic acid assay is EQV to pyruvate
assay.  In MedDRA you would might see something like:
<pre>Pyruvate as an LT
and Pyruvic Acid as an LT</pre>
<p>These would be merged.

<p>9. For the MedDRA findings, Blood X increased is not equivalent to Serum X increased. 
These are considered two separate concepts and should only be related if a relationship 
already exists between them.

<br><br>Also, X increased is not equivalent to Blood X increased or Serum X increased or any other 
Substance X increased. X increased does not specify anything about where it was measured 
so it should be kept separate.

<br><br>In these cases for the following strings:
<pre>Blood gastrin increased-MDR PT
Gastrin increased-MDR LT
Serum gastrin increased MDR LT

None of those strings should be merged together.
