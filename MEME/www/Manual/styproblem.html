<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> If you have a diagnostic or laboratory procedure that

<BR>Laboratory Procedure &amp; Machine Activity  or <BR>Diagnostic Procedure &amp;
Machine Activity?
<UL>

concepts to the causative agent(s).   ICD/MX codes are not synonymous with &quot;poisoning
by&quot; atoms,  they are related and should be merged only with those agents or
chemicals causing the problem.  STYs for MX codes should come from the Substance
hierarchy of the Semantic Network.</LI></UL></LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> How should the Classification STY be used?

</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> 	Are  drug-induced conditions typed as &quot;Injury or
Poisoning&quot;? 		For example:  steroid induced diabetes mellitus, tardive

<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> No.  Side effects are not to be typed as &quot;Injury or
Poisoning&quot;.  On the other hand, drug overdoses can be considered
poisonings; and therefore, the &quot;Injury or Poisoning&quot; STY can be
assigned to overdose concepts..</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><B>QUESTION:</B> How does an editor assign STYS to concepts that refer to &quot;toxic
effect and &quot;adverse effect&quot;?
<UL>
<LI><B>ANSWER:</B> Both are to be STY'd as injury and poisoning only. They
will no longer be double typed as pathologic function and injury or poisoning.
Exceptions will be reviewed on an individual basis, with emphasis on the source

assigned and when should &quot;Professional or Occupational Group&quot; be
assigned?

refers to the field or discipline as a whole, the STY of &quot;Occupation or
Discipline&quot; is assigned. For example, Gardening or Genetics.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
