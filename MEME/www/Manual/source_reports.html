<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Reporting problems with Source Content</H3>
<P>For problems or errors with source content, editors should send an e-mail
message to <A HREF="mailto:umlsmeta@nlm.nih.gov">umlsmeta@nlm.nih.gov</A>. This
address is where NLM keeps an archive of problems with sources that can be
reported at the appropriate time. Examples of items that can go to this address
are:<BR><BR>Typos in the concept names from a source<BR>Questions about
meaning of concepts as defined by a source<BR>Questions about relationships
between concepts as defined by a source</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>If the source in question is MeSH, messages can be sent to
<A HREF="mailto:meshsugg@nlm.nih.gov">meshsugg@nlm.nih.gov</A>. </P>
<P>Editors should still edit the concepts that they have source questions about
and edit them according to the source's meaning. Editors still need to edit the
concept and not wait for an answer to their messages. Some of the issues may not
be addressed until some point in the future. <B>Note:</B> If an editor thinks
that the problems are the result of a data issue, they need to report it
immediately to NLM per the instructions given for reporting MEME-II problems.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Remember that we have to represent the meaning in sources; and when the
source has already published and used a version, it needs to be represented in
Meta.  We also have different relationships with different sources, which in
turn have different abilities to accept and make corrections.</P>
