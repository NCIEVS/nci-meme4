<LI><B>7.1.5.0 Introduction to Classes screen - </B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="classes"></P>
<P>The Classes Screen is used to display all the atoms in a concept and allows
these atoms to be edited (ex. merging, splitting, etc.).  As usual, the concept
name and concept_id is present at the top of the screen in a yellow box so that
the editor is always aware of which concept is being edited.</P>
<P>Atom information is contained in the center of the screen. There is a row
for each atom contained in the concept and then seven columns of information.
The columns are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Switch - The two values in this column are Y (yes) and N (no). The switch
has to be turned to Y in order for a row to be edited. In order to change the
switch to Y, an editor highlights the row to be edited and clicks the green  &quot;Switch&quot;
button. More than one row can be switched to Y at the same time.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Status - Lists the status of the atom - R (Reviewed), N (Needs Review) or U
(Unreviewed).</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Termgroup -  Contains the abbreviation of the source and term type of the
atom.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Code - Identification code assigned to each atom from its source. This is
not assigned by the Metathesaurus.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Atom Name </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Atom_id - Each atom is assigned a unique atom_id to help identify it in the
database.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Authority - Initials of last source or editor that approved this atom.</LI></UL>
<P>There is a sort list at the top of the atom rows that allows editors to
change the order of how the atoms appear. The atom order can be sorted on the
screen  by termgroup rank, SUI, LUI, atom name, source and code. The default is
the termgroup rank which is determined by algorithmic precedence. </P>
<P>As seen in other screens, if an atom has a status of N (Needs Review), it
will appear in red in the interface. If the atom is marked as tbr (to be
released) ='n', it will appear in green. This means the atom is not to be
released at the end of the year.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.1 Move atoms - </B></LI></UL>
<P>If an editor decides that an atom(s) does not belong in the concept, one
option is to Move the atom(s) to another concept. The Move command can only be
used  if there is another concept that the atom can be moved to. If atoms should
be removed from a concept  but there is no concept to move them to, an editor
can Split them out into a whole new concept. Splitting atoms out of a concept
will be discussed in Section 7.1.5.3.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="move"></P>
<P>The Move function can be performed using the Move menu option at the top of
the screen or can be done using the blue button at the bottom of the screen.
With either option, the editor needs to know the concept_id of the concept the
atom(s) is to be moved to. The concept_id is entered into the box next to &quot;switched
atoms into:&quot;. See example above.</P>
<P>Then, an editor switches the atom or atoms to be moved to Y. This is done by
highlighting the desired atom and clicking the green Switch button. The value in
the Switch column should change from N to Y. This can be done on as many atoms
as needed.</P>
<P>Once the atoms are selected, the editor can click the Blue Move button. The
atoms will be removed from the current concept and placed in the specified
concept. If the editor has the SEL screen open, the concept the atoms were moved
to will appear there. An editor can also use the Move menu option to do the same
action.</P>
<P>Once the Move action is performed, the selected atoms should no longer be in
the current concept. To see the atoms, the editor would have to make the concept
they were moved to the Current Concept. When a move is done, the Relationships
and the STYs are not copied over with the atoms.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.2 Merge -  </B></LI></UL>
<P>If an editor decides that all the atoms belong in another concept, the
editor can simply merge the two concepts. Moving or splitting all the atoms in a
concept is not allowed. At least one atom has to be in every concept. Merging of
concepts can be done from the SEL screen but can also be done from the Classes
screen. An editor simply enters the concept_id of the concept to be merged with
the Current Concept (or the concept that is currently being edited) in the
bottom white box on the left side of the screen. Then, the blue Merge button is
clicked or the Merge menu option is chosen. Once the merge is done, all the new
atoms will appear in the Current Concept. They will all be in red since they
will have a status of N (for Needs Review).</P>
<P></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.3 Split - </B></LI></UL>
<P>If an editor decides that an atom (s) does not belong in the concept being
edited, the atoms can be removed by splitting them out. Atoms can be split out
even if there is no concept to merge them to. A split will create a new concept
containing the atoms removed.</P>
<P>To split out atoms, an editor would switch the atoms to be split to Y. This
can be done by highlighting the atom and clicking the Switch button or can be
done by double-clicking the atom. </P>
<P>Then, the editor goes to the Split menu option at the top of the screen and
chooses the relationship that will be created when the new concept is created.
When atoms are split out, the new concept(s) always has a relationship to the
original concept. When the split relationship is selected, the atoms will be
removed from the Current Concept and the new concept will appear in the SEL
screen.</P>
<P>When splitting, the default is for the STYs and the relationships to be
copied with the atoms into the new concept. If this is the desired action, the
editor does not need to do anything. If the editor does not want to copy the
STYs or relationships, the &quot;nocopy&quot; option needs to be selected BEFORE
the split is performed. At the top of the Classes screen, there is an area that
says Rels &amp; STY on Split. Under that is a selection for copy and nocopy. In
order to select nocopy, the editor clicks on the diamond in front of it so that
it turns black. Then, the split can be performed without that information
copying over with it.</P>
<P></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.4 Definitions - </B></LI></UL>
<P>On the right side of the Classes screen, there is a brown button with DEF on
it. If an editor clicks this, the Definitions Editor will open. This screen
allows editors to view definitions associated with atoms and to add definitions.
In most cases, the definitions came with the atoms from their sources.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="classdef"></P>
<P>The Definitions Editor lists the atom_id, the termgroup, the atom name, the
releasability status, the Status, and the initials and date of the last
approval. When a row is highlighted, the definition for that atom will appear at
the bottom of the screen.</P>
<P>An editor can change the status of the definition (to R or N) and can also
change the releasability. An editor can also use this to add a new definition to
an atom to further clarify its meaning.</P>
<P></P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.5 Atom Notes - </B></LI></UL>
<P>Atom notes are similar to Concept notes except that they travel with an atom
and not a concept. So, if an atom is split and merged with a new concept, the
atom note will go with it. When an atom note is present, the Atom Note button
turns red.</P>
<P>To add an Atom Note, an editor would click the Atom Note button. An Atom
Notes screen will appear. An editor can type in the atom note in the white space
at the bottom of the screen. Once the note is typed, the editor selects the Add
menu option. The  atom name will then appear in a row as well as the editor's
initials and the date the atom note was created. To delete an atom note, the
editor selects the row and selects the delete menu option.</P>
<P>When adding atom notes, the name of the atom that the definition is going to
be added to is displayed at the bottom of the screen (as well as the atom_id).
An editor needs to make sure the correct atom is displayed there or the atom
note will get attached to the wrong atom. To change the atom, simply highlight
the desired atom in the Classes screen.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.5.6 Lexical Tags and Lexical Rels - </B></LI></UL>
<P>At the top right of the screen, there are blue buttons for Lexical Rels and
Lexical Tags. Lexical Tags  lead an editor to the Lexical Type Editor.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A><IMG SRC="lextags"></A></P>
<P>The Lexical Type Editor allows an editor to add or delete Lexical Tags to
atoms in a  concept. There are two Lexical Tags that can be added - Trade name
and Lab Number.  If a Lexical Tag exists, a row will appear on the screen under
Lexical Types. It will list the type of tag, the atom name, the Status, the
source of the Tag and the date the tag was added. If an editor wants to delete
the tag, simply highlight the row and select the Delete menu option from the top
of the screen.</P>
<P>To add a Lexical Tag, an editor first needs to specify the atom that the tag
is to be attached to. To use the Lexical Type Editor, the SEL screen needs to be
open also. An editor would just highlight the desired atom on the SEL screen.
The atom_id and atom name should appear on the bottom of the Editor screen (see
example above). Once the atom information appears in the Editor screen, the
editor can select which tag to add by clicking on the diamond shape in front of
the choices. The, the editor needs to select the Add menu option at the top of
the screen. Once this is done, the atom and tag information will appear in the
rows in the middle of the screen.</P>
<P>The Lexical Rels button will lead to the Lexical Rels Editor. This is where
an editor can add an SFO/LFO relationship to a concept.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="lexrels"></P>
<P>The Editor screen will list any SFO/LFO relationships that already exist in
the rows in the middle of the screen. In the example above, there are two
relationships. The two atoms involved in the relationship are listed as well as
the status, the authority and the date the rel was added.  To delete a rel,
simply highlight the appropriate row and select the delete option from the menu
at the top of the screen.</P>
<P>To add a rel, the SEL screen must also be open. The SFO atom is highlighted
in the SEL screen and the Blue SFO button is clicked so that the atom appears in
the SFO box on the editor (See atom_id #3083821 above). Then, the LFO atom is
highlighted in the SEL screen  and the blue LFO button is clicked so that the
atom appears in the LFO box on the editor (see atom_id #3083822 above). Then,
the Add menu option is selected from the top of the screen and the new rel will
appear on the Editor screen.</P>
