<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Naming of Multiple Meanings</H1>
<H3>Every multiple meaning term should have an unambiguous, short,
fully-specified name as one of the strings in the concept class.  If one does
not exist, the editing task will be to create one  following the rules below: 
</H3>
<H3>1. If there is a good umambiguous fully-specified atom name already in the
concept, it should be indicated as the preferred name.</H3>
<H3>2.  If you already know a good synonym, but one that is not in any of the
source vocabularies, use it.</H3>
<H3>3.  Use phrases without prepositions if possible.  E.g., &quot;gentamicin
assay&quot; is to be preferred over &quot;assay of gentamicin.&quot;
</H3>
<H3>4.  Avoid terms that are not explicit in their common usage.  E.g., &quot;gentamicin
 level&quot; is ambiguous, as it could mean either the assay or the result.
</H3>
<H3>5.  Do not use names which are inverted around commas. </H3>
<H3>6.  Frequently a single word addition will suffice.  E.g., &quot;common
cold&quot; will differentiate the disease from the environment. </H3>
<H3>7.  For the chemicals and lab test involving a chemical, the unambiguous
string  should always carry the generic name for the chemical.</H3>
<H3>8.  As a last result, the use of parentheses to indicate the field in which
a term has a special meaning, can be used.  E.g., &quot;Displacement 
(Psychology)&quot;  
</H3>
<H3>9. If there are concept names that are identical except for case, PNs can
be created that are identical except for case as long as the PNs are
unambiguous. An example of this type of PN assignment is as follows:</H3>
<PRE>Possible hypothetical blood group antigens:

Blood Group Antigen Aa
Blood Group Antigen AA

PNs would be created that look like the two strings above.

For someone who works on blood groups, this is unambiguous so we DO NOT have
to create:

Blood Group Antigen Upper Case Aay Lower Case Aay
Blood Group Antigen Upper Case Aay Upper Case Aay</PRE>
<H3>10. If the meaning of the term is Reason for Encounter: X, the PN that
should be created is Encounter due to X. For example: #1683382  Child Abuse &lt;2&gt;
is assigned the PN of Encounter due to child abuse.</H3>
<H3>11. When creating PNs, use the American spelling of a word or phrase. </H3>
