<LI><B>7.1.1.0 Introduction to Main editing interface screen</B></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="mainscreen"></P>
<P>The main editing interface screen is what appears when the editing interface is first
opened.  If editing is enabled, the main screen appears with no messages for the
editors. If editing has been disabled, a message appears telling editors that
editing is cutoff.</P>
<P>There is some <STRONG>VERY</STRONG>  important information on the main
screen. At the top, the database to be edited is listed - for example,
oa::mid2002.  Since there are  multiple databases at NLM,  including the actual
editing database, a test database and a production database, it is important
that the correct database for editing is being used.</P>
<P>The next piece of information shown is the editing interface image date.
Again, an editor needs to make sure that the most current image is being used.
Finally, the editor's initials are shown.  These are the initials used in the
database to record authority. If the initials are not correct, NLM should be
notified.</P>
<P>An editor can use Meow to check to make sure that the information that
appears on their interface is correct. The home page for Meow (<A
HREF="http://meow.nlm.nih.gov">http://meow.nlm.nih.gov</A>) contains this
information near the top under the Database Information section.</P>
<P>At the top of the screen, there is a menu bar with five options.
Close will shut down the editing interface. The other four menu options are
described below.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.1.1 EDIT - </B></LI></UL>
<P>This option provides editors access to concepts using different
retrieval methods.</P>
<P><STRONG>Worklist</STRONG> displays the concepts on a  worklist the editor
has already selected to edit.  If no worklist has been selected, the Concept_id
screen will appear (See Section 7.1.1.2 <b>SET</b> - Work List  to find out more about selecting
worklists).</P>
<P><STRONG>Concept_id</STRONG> uses a concept_id to pull up the corresponding
concept. It is used when an editor knows the exact concept_id and can zero in on the
concept that needs to be looked at. To use, an editor types the concept_id
number into the yellow box at the top of the screen. Then, the editor hits
Return or uses the mouse and clicks on on the long grey box below. This causes
the concept name to appear.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="concept_id"></P>
<P>Then,  the EDIT button can be clicked to pull up the concept in the Concept
Selector screen or the Concept button can be clicked to pull up the concept in
the Concept screen. It is important that the concept name appear in the grey box
otherwise the Selector screen and the Concept screen come up empty since the
system does not recognize that a concept has been selected.</P>
<P><B>Finder</B> is used to find concepts using search terms. For more
information, please see section 7.1.2.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.1.2 SET - </B></LI></UL>
<P>This option allows editors to set some preferences for their editing
interface.</P>
<P><STRONG>Editor's Initials</STRONG> shows what initials are assigned to the
editor. It also lists the editing level assigned. These values can only be
changed by authorized users.</P>
<P><STRONG>Editor's Preferences</STRONG> can be used to change the display
options when an editor begins to edit. The default display  is for only the
Selector screen to display when a concept is chosen but the other display
options include the Concept screen, the Classes screen, the Relationships
screen, and the Attributes screen. An editor has the option to turn these
screens off or on for initial display of a concept to be edited.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="preferences"></P>
<P>The Preferences screen consists of a list of the screen display choices and
a box that indicates if the display is on or off. To turn a screen display on,
the box to the right of the screen name is clicked. The screen then goes from
Off to On and the box is  now black. To turn a screen display off, the black box
to the right of the screen name is clicked and the box should become blank again
and the display will be listed as Off. An editor can  go into the preferences at
any time during an editing session and make changes to the preferences. </P>
<P>When an editor makes changes to the Preferences, those changes are only good
for the current editing session unless the Record feature is used. If an editor
simply closes the preferences screen after making changes, the options selected
will only last for the current editing session. Once the session is closed down, the
preferences will switch back to the default.  The Record  function can be used
to save the changes for future editing sessions. An editor can make changes and
then click on the Record button. This will save the information until an editor
makes changes to the preferences again. To undo the preferences recorded, an
editor has to go back into the preferences screen and re-record.</P>
<P><STRONG>Work List</STRONG> allows an editor to select a worklist to work
on. A list of all the worklists available in the editing database are displayed.
 The editor highlights the worklist to be edited. Then, the SELECT button is
clicked and a list of all the concepts in the worklist are displayed with their
concept_id and concept name. When an editor selects a worklist, this is what
appears throughout the editing session as the worklist to edit. If an editor
uses the Edit menu option later in the editing session and highlights Work List,
the selected worklist will appear.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="worklist"></P>
<P>The name of the worklist is displayed at the top of the screen (ex.
wrk02b_uwda155_nc_47) and each concept on the worklist is displayed. An editor
will see the concept name, concept_id, cluster_id, row_id and status for each concept on
the worklist. If a concept needs editing, an editor can highlight the concept in
the list. Then, click on the EDIT button. This will place the concept in the SEL
screen and editing can begin. If the concept just needs approval, click on the
Approve/Next button. If an editor does not want to approve a concept and wants
to move on down the list, the Not Approved/Next button is clicked and the next
concept on the list is highlighted.</P>
<P>Concepts on worklists are also divided into clusters. Clusters are sets of
concepts that should be edited together. Each concept displays a cluster_id in the Work List screen.
If an editor wants to view all the concepts in a cluster,  highlight one of the
concepts and click on the Copy Cluster button. This will  transfer all the
concepts in the cluster to the SEL screen for editing. </P>
<P><STRONG>Browse and Edit</STRONG> refer to the status of the database.
Browse allows an editor to look at the database but no changes can be made. When
the interface is in Browse mode, a Browse box appears on the main screen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="browse"></P>
<P>In the interface, the editing menu options will be greyed out and
unavailable. The Edit mode is used to change the database from Browse back to
Edit. This allows editing to continue.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.1.3 HELP - </B></LI></UL>
<P>Under HELP is the Use Menu and Show Versions box. The Use Menu displays short descriptions of the
Main screen menu options and what they mean. The HELP screen also leads to the
Show Versions screen. This screen lists  version information of the different
components of the editing interface. If an editor is asked what versions are in
the editing interface being used, this is where the information is found. It is
automatically updated when new versions are released.</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>7.1.1.4 DBA - </B></LI></UL>
<P>This allows database administrators to cutoff and enable editing on the
database. If authorization for this function is not allowed, the options in this
menu are grey and unavailable. For most editors, this option will be grey. </P>
