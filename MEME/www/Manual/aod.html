<LI>AOD DE (descriptor) terms are AOD's equivalent to preferred terms in other
sources. They are accompanied by hierarchies and in some case definitions.  For
context information:
<PRE>The treenumbers were used to create contexts for AOD, and also
to default semantic types.
Some of the contexts look a little strange, e.g. 
in the example below, AOD provided a broader/narrower rel between
&quot;amphibia&quot; and &quot;bufo toad.&quot;  However, &quot;bufo toad&quot; is only treed
under &quot;bufotenine.&quot;  This made the default semantic type for
&quot;bufo toad&quot; become &quot;pharmacologic substance,&quot; because it was inherited
from its &quot;tree&quot; parent.   If there are questions about the 
data, please consult the AOD printed books before assuming
the inversion was wrong!

<LI>AOD NP (Non-Preferred) terms may be synonymous with a DE or other NP term
in AOD.  They are similar to entry terms in other sources. For insertion
purposes, many NPs were not merged with their corresponding DEs since synonymy
could not be guaranteed. RT? relationships were created so that editors could
review for synonymy.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>AOD ET (Other Preferred) terms are considered to be neither a descriptor or
a synonym to a descriptor.  AOD's  use of &quot;OP&quot; for &quot;Other
Preferred Term&quot; is inconsistent  with other sources (it is not the same
thing as a READ OP term). AOD's use of OP appears to correspond to our use of ET
(entry term)  so they have been changed  to ET terms  to avoid confusion. Unlike
other sources,  AOD ETs can have context with them. For example:

<LI>According to AOD, there are several phrases which AOD has created internal
acronyms for (for example AODU, &quot;other drugs and alcohol use&quot;). When a
term contains one of these acronyms, it has been assigned to the termgroup *S
(short form of whatever termgroup they belong to) and an expanded form has been
created under the termgroup *X (Expanded Term). A SFO/LFO relationships  exists
between the two forms.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Relationships marked as RT? may be synonymous, related, broader or
narrower. In many cases, RT? is the relationships created between an NP and the
DE it is associated with. Editors should carefully review RT? relationships
between AOD terms while editing.</LI></UL>
