<H1>LVG in the Metathesaurus</H1>

The NLS group releases the LVG (Lexical Variant Generator) program
suite with the UMLS.  LVG is part of the SPECIALIST system.
The LVG release cycle is annual (around August) while the UMLS
is released more frequently.

<P>

LVG's <EM>norm</EM> program is used to precompute index entries for
English language strings and words in the Metathesaurus.  These are
distributed in the MRXNS_ENG.RRF and MRXNW_ENG.RRF files respectively.
The <EM>luiNorm</EM> program (a variant of norm), is used to compute
the LUI class, i.e., strings that share a luiNorm form will be
assigned the same LUI.  No guarantees are made regarding LUI
maintenance, that is if a string has a certain LUI in one release of
the Metathesaurus, it may or may not have the same LUI in other
versions.

<P>

Obviously, the version of norm and luiNorm used to generate the index
files must match the version distributed with the UMLS in the LEX
directory.

<H1>LVG in the Editing System</H1>

The <EM>luiNorm</EM> program is used extensively in the Metathesaurus
editing and maintenance system (MEME).  Many quality assurance queries
in the database are lexical in nature and use luiNorm internally.
Our editors also have access to luiNorm in their tools (Web, Jekyll, etc)
to flexibly look for matching strings in the database.  In rare cases,
new atoms are created at NLM and added to the database.  The normalized
forms of these atoms are generated using LVG.

<P>

The tables in the MID that contain the normalized data are: normstr, normwrd
and word_index (lowercased words).

<H1>Tools</H1>

Simple access to the LVG tools via the LVG server:
