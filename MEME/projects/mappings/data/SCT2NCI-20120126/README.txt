Joanne,

OK, As an outcome from a meeting with this guy David Mulvihill, we have a new SNOMED to NCI mapping project based on 
NCI-META.  I recommend we use the same methodology as before to produce the candidates and we can review the map before 
handing it back.

In the attachment, I think you’ll mostly need “SNOMED_Clinical_Diagnosis.xls” which is the subset of SNOMEDCT codes that we 
are going to attempt to map to NCIt.  We could also consider “CBM_SNOMED_Map.xls” as a basis for the final data that we 
return from this project.

We’ve kept track of the code for this in the repository: https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/ncimeta/trunk/MEME/projects/mappings/ 
And there’s the reports page on the wiki that links to this.

I think we should just make this project another instance of the things here – and put the data files from the attachment we 
use along in the repository.  I think this stuff is all checked out on cbioapp513 somewhere already.

We can talk about this more tomorrow/Friday if needed.

Brian

Hello All-

Thanks again for taking time to meet with me today concerning mapping of diagnosis values from SNOMED to NCI.  Attached is a 
zip file containing three files as described below:

CBM_SNOMED_Map.xls - my attempt to map the SNOMED_Clinical_Diagnosis.xls to EVS definitions and mappings_caDSR.xls via the 
UMLS (duplicates exist here which is OK)

EVS definitions and mapping_caDSR.xls – CBM dx NCI codes 

SNOMED_Clinical_Diagnosis.xls – caTissue dx SNOMED codes


Please let me know if you require more information.
 

Thanks,

Dave
