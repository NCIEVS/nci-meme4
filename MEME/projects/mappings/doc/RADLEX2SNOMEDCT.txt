Mapping:          RADLEX to SNOMEDCT
Requested by:     Pat Mongkolwat (p-mongkolwat@northwestern.edu)
                  via Sherri DeCoronado (decorons@mail.nih.gov)
Requested output: Excel spreadsheet
Script:           dump_radlex_mappings.csh

Details:

A caBIG user requested some info about RADLEX from the UMLS: definitions (from RADLEX and other sources sharing the same CUI), SNOMEDCT terms, and a list of RADLEX PTs with their associated SYs.

I divided the output into three Excel tabs for readability.

tab 1: CUI | RADLEX code | RADLEX PT | CUI PT [Source/Term Type] | definition | definition source
tab 2: CUI | RADLEX code | RADLEX PT | CUI PT [Source/Term Type] | SNOMEDCT term | SNOMEDCT code
tab 3: CUI | RADLEX code | RADLEX PT | CUI PT [Source/Term Type] | RADLEX SY

This was done in TESTSW after copyout but before production, due to time constraints.

Hi,
Would like to request a report from the new NCI Meta RRF export that contains the new RadLex (probably not avail till end of week) - Gilberto and I discussed and think probably best to ask Alameda to produce this.  Info below, but in essence, here is what Pat is looking for.  (Note: he's the AIM project PI, this is in line with BSA report interests).

RadLex 3.33 export in excel or some delimited format that includes the following:

Source|CUI|Source Code (RID)|Preferred Term| Definition (any definition present, with source identification if possible)|SNOMED term if present|SNOMED ID if present|RadLex Synonyms|

I realize it won't be quite this simply structured with multiple synonyms; you probably get multiple records per concept.  I'll ask if that is OK.  Similar for definitions.  I don't think he's thought about that.  Also, the SNOMED matches will be uncurated.  A flat file seems less than ideal for this.

Happy to discuss further with Alameda once tasked.  Thanks, Sherri
