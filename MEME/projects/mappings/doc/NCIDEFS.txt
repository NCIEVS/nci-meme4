Mapping:          NCI + Definitions
Requested by:     Pat Mongkolwat (p-mongkolwat@northwestern.edu)
                  via Sherri DeCoronado (decorons@mail.nih.gov)
Requested output: Flat file
Script:           dump_nci_definitions.csh

Details:

A caBIG user requested some info about NCI + its definitions from the UMLS.

I exported the file as a pipe-delimited flat file with the following format:

tab 1: CUI | NCI code | NCI PT | definition | definition source

This was performed in MEMEDB.
