Mapping:          SNOMEDCT to ICD10CM
Requested by:     NCI EVS
Requested output: Excel
Script:           dump_sct-to-icd10cm_mappings.csh

Description:

This script maps these SNOMEDCT atoms to ICD10CM atoms based on shared CUI (SY mappings).

The mappings are ranked using the following algorithm (1 being best, increasing values being less accurate):
- To start, 2 points are given to each mapping
- Subtract 1 (award) if both sides of the mapping are Preferred Terms (i.e., NCI/PT, SNOMEDCT/FN)

The output format (in Excel) is:
SNOMDCT Code | SNOMEDCT PT | Rel | Map Rank | ICD10CM Code | ICD10CM PT |
