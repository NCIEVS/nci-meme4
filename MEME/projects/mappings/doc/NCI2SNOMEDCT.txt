Mapping:          NCI Thesaurus to SNOMEDCT
Requested by:     NCI EVS
Requested output: MRMAP.RRF
Script:           dump_snomedct_mappings.csh

Description:

This script identifies the Neoplasm NCI/PT atom (aui=A2662660) and its children.  It then maps these atoms to SNOMEDCT atoms in the following order:

1) Find SNOMEDCT atoms in the same CUI (concept_id). These are SY mappings.
2) For NCI atoms not mapped in 1), use parent/child context relationships and look for ICD9CM atoms in those concepts. These are RN/RB mappings.
3) For NCI atoms not mapped in 1) or 2), use grandparent/grandchild context relationships and look for ICD9CM atoms in those concepts. These are also RN/RB mappings.

The mappings are ranked using the following algorithm (1 being best, increasing values being less accurate):
- To start, 2 points are given to each mapping
- Subtract 1 (award) if both sides of the mapping are Preferred Terms (i.e., NCI/PT, SNOMEDCT/FN)
- Add 1 (penalize) if NCI concept is involved involved a merge
- Add 1 (penalize) if NCI concept is involved in a split
- Add 1 (penalize) if SNOMEDCT concept is involved in a merge
- Add 1 (penalize) if SNOMEDCT concept is involved in a split
