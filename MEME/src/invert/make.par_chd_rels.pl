# usage: make.par_chd_rels.pl SAB

# used to create the file "par_chd_rels" which is used by the
# script read.sty.pl

# reads the file TREEPOS and gathers the last two source atoms ids
# from each line and collects them in a file with this format:
# parent_src_atom_id|child_source_atom_id

# also writes a file of all the source atoms ids:
# "all.terms.needing.sty.tmp"
#
# use this file (via 'sort -u') to create a file of all the src
# atom ids that have stys. then remove from this list all occurances
# rom the file "sty_term_id" to create the file "no_sty_term_ids"
#
# sort -u all.terms.needing.sty.tmp > ! all.terms.needing.sty.sort.tmp
# cut -d\| -f1 sty_term_ids > sty_term_ids.said.tmp
# comm -13  sty_term_ids.said.tmp all.terms.needing.sty.sort.tmp > no_sty_term_ids
